# 🚀 What’s New in Embeddable

In the last months we shipped several updates to make building and managing dashboards more intuitive and flexible. From improvements to the data modeling experience to new ways to configure inputs and control versioning, here’s a quick look at what’s new.

---

## 1. Data Model Editor

You can now create and edit data models directly in Embeddable.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/data-model-editor.png"]}/>

#### Why it matters:

This makes it easier to define models and build dashboards faster, especially for teams getting started.

#### What’s new:

- Create, edit, and delete no-code models
- View read-only previews of code-managed models
- Visual editing for models, joins, dimensions, and measures
- Inline YAML preview with copy/download

## 2. Time Granularity Picker

You can now pick a **granularity (day, week, month, etc.)** when using time dimensions—without separate chart types.

<ImageGrid width='50%' images={["/img/time-granularity.png"]}/>


#### Why it matters:

No more duplicating charts just to handle time-based grouping.

#### What’s new:

- Granularity dropdown appears when selecting a time dimension
- "Day" is default for new charts; existing charts stay unchanged
- Works in Builder and Playground


## 3. Cube Version Picker

Control exactly which **Cube.js version** your dashboards use.

<ImageGrid width='50%' images={["/img/cube-version-picker.png"]}/>

#### Why it matters:

Test safely before going live and avoid breaking changes from upstream Cube updates.

#### What’s new:

- New "Cube version" picker in Builder and Playground
- Default is latest, but you can switch freely
- Live embeddables only update after you publish with a selected version


## 4. Sub Inputs for Dimensions & Measures

You can now define **custom sub inputs** per dimension or measure in chart configurations.

<ImageGrid width='50%' images={["/img/sub-inputs.png"]}/>

#### Why it matters:

Allows specifying a number of additional settings (e.g. title / granularity / rounding / etc.) per dimension or measure in components.

#### examples:

- Add a prefix/suffix to string fields
- Customize date formatting for time fields
- Rename columns with user-friendly labels

## 5. Dimension & Measure Variables

You can now use dimensions and measures as variables and link them directly as inputs to dashboard components.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/dim-meas-vars-pie-example.mp4"
    width="400"
    height="459"
/>

#### Why it matters:

A popular feature that teams want to be able to implement is the ability to allow end-users to dynamically change the measures or dimensions that are being shown on a dashboard.  E.g. you could have a dropdown containing a list of dimensions or measures, and then when users switch to another dimension or measure, all the charts update to show that dimension or measure.  This is now easy to do in Embeddable.

#### What’s new:

- New variable types: “Dimension”, “Measure”, and “Dimension or Measure” available in the variable type dropdown.
- Select from all available dimensions or measures across your models, with support for single or multi-select.
- Easily link these variables as inputs to components, just like other variable types.

## 6. In-App AI Support (Powered by Inkeep)

We’ve added an **AI assistant across the platform** so you can get help instantly—without leaving the app.

#### Why it matters:

Search across docs, FAQs, roadmap, and changelogs without needing to message us.

#### What’s new:

- ‘Ask AI’ button in the top-right corner of the Embeddable platform, or bottom-right in the documentation
- AI pulls answers from all support content
