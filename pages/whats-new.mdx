# 🚀 What’s New in Embeddable

In Q2 we developed several new features. Here is an overview of the most important updates.

## 1. Data Model Editor

You can now create and edit data models directly in Embeddable.

### Why it matters:**

This makes it easier to define models and build dashboards faster, especially for teams getting started.

### What’s new:**

- Create, edit, and delete no-code models
- View read-only previews of code-managed models
- Visual editing for models, joins, dimensions, and measures
- Inline YAML preview with copy/download

**2. Time Granularity Picker**

You can now pick a **granularity (day, week, month, etc.)** when using time dimensions—without separate chart types.

**Why it matters:**

No more duplicating charts just to handle time-based grouping.

**What’s new:**

- Granularity dropdown appears when selecting a time dimension
- "Day" is default for new charts; existing charts stay unchanged
- Works in Builder and Playground
- Powered by a new `select` parameter in `loadData`

**3. Cube Version Picker**

Control exactly which **Cube.js version** your dashboards use.

**Why it matters:**

Test safely before going live and avoid breaking changes from upstream Cube updates.

**What’s new:**

- New "Cube version" picker in Builder and Playground
- Default is latest, but you can switch freely
- Live embeddables only update after you publish with a selected version

---

**4. Sub Inputs for Dimensions & Measures**

You can now define **custom sub inputs** per dimension or measure in chart configurations.

**Why it matters:**

Fine-tune how values are displayed—without writing custom logic.

**Examples:**

- Add a prefix/suffix to string fields
- Customize date formatting for time fields
- Rename columns with user-friendly labels

---

**5. Dimension & Measure Variables**

You can now use dimensions and measures as variables and link them directly as inputs to dashboard components.

**Why it matters:**

[...]

**What’s new:**

- New variable types: “Dimension”, “Measure”, and “Dimension or Measure” available in the variable type dropdown.
- Select from all available dimensions or measures across your models, with support for single or multi-select.
- Easily link these variables as inputs to components, just like other variable types.

**6. In-App AI Support (Powered by Inkeep)**

We’ve added an **AI assistant across the platform** so you can get help instantly—without leaving the app.

**Why it matters:**

Search across docs, FAQs, roadmap, and changelogs without needing to message us.

**What’s new:**

- Ask product questions in Workspace, Builder, Preview, or Docs
- AI pulls answers from all support content
