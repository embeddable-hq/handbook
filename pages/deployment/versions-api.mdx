# List Dashboard Versions

The **Versions API** allows you to programmatically list the last thirty saved versions of a specific dashboard (Embeddable) in your workspace. This is useful for managing deployments, rolling back changes, or promoting versions through your development workflow.

## Endpoint

```
GET https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/embeddables/{embeddableId}/saved-versions
```

## Example Request

```ts
// Important: Always call this server-side, never from client-side code
fetch('https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/embeddables/{embeddableId}/saved-versions', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Keep your API key secure
  }
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "development": { "version": "v3", "updated-at": "2025-06-27T09:32:10.004Z" },
    "production": { "version": "v2", "updated-at": "2025-06-21T16:12:53.542Z" }
  },
  "saved-versions": [
    {
      "version": "v1",
      "saved-by": "sina@embeddable.com",
      "description": "Our first publish!!",
      "saved-at": "2025-06-19T09:01:03.023523Z",
      "components-version": "2025-02-11T18:53:03.527633Z",
      "models-version": "2025-02-11T18:53:03.527633Z", // cube-internal only
      "cube-version": "1.3.22" // cube-internal only
    }
    // ... up to last 30
  ]
}
```

## Field Reference

- **`tags.development / staging / production`**: Present only if the embeddable has been published to that tag. `updated-at` is when the tag last changed.
- **`saved-versions[]`**: Each saved version, newest first.
  - **`version`**: The generated version label (v1, v2, ...).
  - **`saved-by`**: Email of the user who saved it.
  - **`description`**: The Save version note. Also appears in the builder and publish modal.
  - **`saved-at`**: When the snapshot was taken.
  - **`components-version / models-version / cube-version`**: The underlying versions that this saved version references.

## Notes

- Version values are **per embeddable** and are not shared across different dashboards.
- The API returns the last 30 saved versions, ordered by the `saved-at` timestamp.
- You can use this API endpoint to build custom deployment workflows, such as automatically promoting versions from development to production based on your CI/CD processes.
