# Deployment Regions

We currently support `US` and `EU` deployment regions (more coming soon).

Depending on your region, your workspace will be hosted at one of these sites:

 - [https://app.us.embeddable.com](https://app.us.embeddable.com) for US.
 - [https://app.eu.embeddable.com](https://app.eu.embeddable.com) for EU.

When you go to https://embeddable.com and click "Log in", make sure to pick the appropriate region:

### Update Your Configuration

In your code repo, you'll need to update your `embeddable.config.js` file ([here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components/blob/main/embeddable.config.js)) to point to the correct region:

```js
...

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  region: 'US'
});
```

or

```js
...

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  region: 'EU'
});
```

### Embedding Script Tag

When [embedding](/deployment/embedding), youâ€™ll also need to use the correct `<script>` tag:

```js
<script 
  type="module" 
  src="https://embed.embeddable.com/js/v1/?region=<region>">
</script>
```

where `<region>` is one of `US` or `EU`.  E.g. for `US`:

```js
<script 
  type="module" 
  src="https://embed.embeddable.com/js/v1/?region=US">
</script>
```

Learn more about embedding [here](/deployment/embedding).

### IPs to Whitelist

For direct database connections:

 - For US use `98.82.255.116`
 - For EU use `3.125.110.225`

For connections via SSH:

 - For US use `35.171.35.74`
 - For EU use `3.77.50.38`

### Static Domains to Whitelist

This is only needed if your end-users need to whitelist which domains they can load static assets from.

Web-component
```js
static-data.<region>.embeddable.com
```

Bundled components
```js
bundles.<region>.embeddable.com
```

where `<region>` is one of `us` or `eu`.
