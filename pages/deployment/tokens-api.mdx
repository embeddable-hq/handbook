# Retrieving Security Tokens

Whenever a user accesses an Embeddable dashboard in your app, you should fetch a **security token** from our **Tokens API**. This token applies **row-level security** (and more) to their dashboard session.

## Example: Fetch a Token

**Important**: Always call this **server-side**—never from client code, to avoid exposing your API key.

```ts
fetch('https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/security-token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Keep your API key secure
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    embeddableId: "<dashboard-id>", //the id of the dashboard you want to load
    expiryInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // token expiry (e.g. 1 week)
    securityContext: { // any context you want to provide to the SQL data models
      userId: '9sZSJ9LHsiYXR0cmlidXRlIjoiZ2VvaXBf',
      regions: ['us-east', 'eu-west']
    },
    user: 'sina@embeddable.com', // unique key representing current user
    dashboardState: 'team1-dashboard7', // optional key used by "custom canvas" functionality to store dashboard state
    environment: 'prod' // each environment defines which databases to connect to
    })
  })
})
  .then((resp) => resp.json())
  .then(({ token }) => {
    // 'token' is the JWT your web component needs
    console.log(token);
  });
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzZWN1cml0eVRva2VuSWQiOiI1OGE1NGYwMi0xNTJmLTQxMjgtYWZmZC0zMDhhYzI0NTE5ZGQiLCJpYXQiOjE3MDczMTU1NDUsImV4cCI6MTcwNzkyMDM0NX0.lnovN0xTMCjLcxGTIfzFD9cYRIAZjn6S7sew-ih11lM"
}
```

You would then use this `token` in your `<em-beddable>` element, as explained in [Embedding an Embeddable](/deployment/embedding#how-it-works).

Learn more about `region` [here](/deployment/deployment-regions).


### Parameters

- **`securityContext`** is an arbitrary JSON object included in your token request. Embeddable passes it to your **data models**, allowing you to enforce [row/table/schema-level security](/data-modeling/row-level-security). For example:

    ```sql
    name: Orders
    sql: >
        SELECT user_id, created_at
        FROM public.orders
        WHERE user_id = '{ COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.userId }'
        
        {% if COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.regions %}
            AND region IN {{ list(COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.regions) }}
        {% endif %}
    ```

- **`user`** is a unique identifier for the current user. It enables Embeddable to store (anonymous) session metadata against each user automatically so that customisations / preferences applied by the user to their Embeddable dashboard will automatically be remembered for their next session.

- **`dashboardState`** holds the state of the dashboard based on the end-user’s interactions within Embeddable’s [Custom Canvas](/dashboards/custom-canvas). 

- **`environment`** optionally specifies which [environment](/data/environments) to retrieve data from. By default, “default” is used. This lets you achieve things like:
    - **single-tenancy** (AKA **database-level security**), where each of your customers has their data in a different database.
    - different database connections for **prod**, **qa**, **testing**, etc. 
    - **micro service architecture**, where your data is spread across multiple databases. 

## Testing Security Contexts

If you’re relying on `securityContext` in your data models, you’ll want to **test** them in Embeddable’s no-code builder. You can easily do this by creating [presets](/data-modeling/row-level-security#testing-security-contexts-in-embeddable).
