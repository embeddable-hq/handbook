# Deploying Dashboard Versions

Dashboard versions are a powerful way to manage your dashboard deployments. They allow you to save specific states of your dashboard, including the models, components, and Cube.js versions used. This allows you to:
- **Roll Back** to previous versions if needed.
- **Promote** versions through your development workflow.
- **Test Safely** in Development or Staging before going to Production.

## Two Control Models

There are two main ways to control dashboard versions in Embeddable. In both cases, you'll need to pass `savedVersion` to the Embeddable Tokens API when generating your JWT token (more info [here](/deployment/tokens-api)), but they serve different purposes:

- **Publish Button**: This allows users to publish their own changes directly from the no-code builder. Itâ€™s great for empowering non-technical users to manage their dashboards. Tokens can simply set `savedVersion` to development, staging, or production per environment.

- **Saved Versions via the API**: This is more controlled and allows you to manage versions through your development workflow. You can create specific dashboard versions that can be promoted through your CI/CD pipeline.

## `savedVersion` Strategies

There are three approaches to using `savedVersion` while generating an Embeddable token:

- **latest**: The easiest embed setup. This always shows the most recently saved version and is a good choice for internal sandboxes.
- **development / staging / production**: Use this when dashboard builders control promotion. In all dev environments, set `savedVersion` to "development" and vary your data via the environment parameter. In all test environments, use "staging". In all prod environments, use "production".
- **vX**: This provides fine-grained control by engineering. It allows you to gradually roll out to subsets of customers, pin a specific version during incident response, or land a PR that updates `savedVersion` in code, then let CI/CD promote through your environments as usual.

## Example Usage

For a complete example, see the [Tokens API documentation](/deployment/tokens-api).

## Get Available Versions

Use the **[Versions API](/deployment/versions-api)** to list saved versions for an embeddable and see current tags.
