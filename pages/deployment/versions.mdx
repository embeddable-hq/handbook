# Deploying Dashboard Versions

[Saved dashboard versions](/dashboards/saving) are a powerful way to manage your **dashboard deployments**. They allow your [dashboard builders](/dashboards/introduction) to **save specific versions** of their dashboards (including the dashboard layout, the models, components, and Cube.js versions used) and you can control (via [API](/deployment/tokens-api)) which of these saved versions are shown to which group of users. 

This allows you to:
- **Test Safely** a new saved dashboard version in Development or Staging before going to Production.
- **Roll Back** to previous versions if needed.
- **Promote** versions through your development workflow using code (or [in our UI](/dashboards/publishing)).

## Two Control Models

There are two main ways to control dashboard versions in Embeddable. In both cases, you'll need to pass `savedVersion` to the Embeddable [Tokens API](/deployment/tokens-api) when generating your [Security Token](/deployment/embedding#place-the-em-beddable-element), but they serve different purposes:

- **Publish Button**: This allows users to publish their own changes directly from the no-code builder (learn more [here](/dashboards/publishing)). Itâ€™s great for empowering non-technical users to manage their dashboards. When calling the **Token API**, simply set `savedVersion` to "development", "staging", or "production" per environment (see example [here](/deployment/tokens-api)).

- **Saved Versions via the API**: This is more controlled and allows you to manage versions through your development workflow. You can create specific dashboard versions that can be promoted through your CI/CD pipeline.

## Saved Versions via the API

Use this approach if you want your engineering team to have fine-grained control over which saved versions are deployed where.

E.g:

 - You could release a new version to a subset of customers to get feedback before releasing to everyone.

 - You can also apply the version to your main codebase as part of a PR, and then promote that version through your different environments via your standard code promotion mechanism (e.g. merging into main branch)

To do this, simply pass the exact version to `savedVersion` in the [Tokens API](/deployment/tokens-api), like this: 

```ts
fetch('https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/security-token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Keep your API key secure
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    embeddableId: "<dashboard-id>", //the id of the dashboard you want to load
    savedVersion: "v4", // or "v11", etc.
    ...
    })
  })
})
```

You can get the version number directly from the [Saved Versions picker](/dashboards/saving#version-picker) or by calling the [Versions API](/deployment/versions-api).

## Get Available Versions

Use the **[Versions API](/deployment/versions-api)** to list saved versions for an embeddable and see current tags.
