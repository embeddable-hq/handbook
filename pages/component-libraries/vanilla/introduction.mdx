# Vanilla Components

Initially created as an example of what clients _could_ build with Embeddable, Vanilla Components has since evolved into a robust, production-ready component library. It offers a solid foundation for teams looking to create custom analytics experiences with speed and flexibility. While we recommend [Remarkable Pro](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/introduction) for most use cases, we will continue to support and maintain Vanilla Components v1.x for existing users.

Vanilla Components includes:

- **Core visualizations**: bar, line, pie/donut, KPI tiles, tables, heatmaps, etc.
- **Essential controls**: dropdowns, multi-selects, date pickers (UTC-safe and time zone friendly), and custom filters.
- **Theming support**: easily customize colors, typography, and spacing to match your brand.
- **extensibility**: override any component with a custom implementation.
