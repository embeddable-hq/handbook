# Patch Notes - Vanilla Components v1

Version 1 of Vanilla Components introduced components as an NPM package, and is the new standard for Embeddable development that this documentation references. This page contains patch notes for each NPM release of Vanilla Components, including bug fixes, new features, and breaking changes (if any).

## Version 1.3.1 - Style Custom Canvas UI

- Added a new, optional theme property that allows users to customize the appearance of the Custom Canvas UI using CSS variabales. This includes colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the UI. For more information, please see [Styling Custom Canvas in Vanilla Components](/component-libraries/vanilla/styling-custom-canvas).

## Version 1.3.0 - Final Major Release

This is expected to be the final major release of Vanilla Components as we begin to sunset the library (there may still be small bug fixes). We encourage all new users to use [Remarkable Pro](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/introduction), and encourage existing users to upgrade when convenient for them. Questions about upgrading? You can reach out to us in our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/embeddablecommunity/shared_invite/zt-20b4f6s10-gULqO6riqutJcbUi_FJmZA).

This release includes the following changes, fixes, and improvements:

### Major Changes

- **Advanced Table Pagination**. Users can now choose to enable advanced pagination on the table, component. This allows first/last page buttons, prevents the bug where it's possible to page past the final page of data, and shows the total number of pages. On large datasets, this may incur a performance penalty. This is **off** by default for backwards compatibility.

- **Fix Major Tailwind Compile Issue**. We've changed the way we use tailwind classes in order to ensure that some arbitrary values we were setting don't go uncompiled. We now use tokens instead of arbitrary values. This change should be seamless for users as all of these classes are still informed by the theme and still use the same values / property names.

### Smaller Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed the issue where an internal Cube.js package file was renamed and it was breaking the build
- Compare Line Chart now works w/ default comparison values (no longer requires the comparison picker but still works with it, too)
- KPI Comparison now works w/ default comparison values (no longer requires the comparison picker but still works with it, too)
- Improved decimal handling so if the user has selected eg 2 decimals, they don't sometimes get only 1
- Ensured that all time series bar charts are the same width when displaying the same number of bars
- Ensured that the date in CSV downloads matches what's being displayed in the table
- Positive KPI increases now display in green (controlled in theme)
- Table and CSV downloads now respect date formats from the theme, matching how they look in graphs/charts

## Version 1.2.1 - Time Zones
  - Added [support for Time Zones](/development/loading-data#params) to Vanilla Components (this was added as v1.2.0 but was not released).
  - Improved Time Zone support, allowing them to be set with Client Context rather than on a per-component basis.

## Version 1.1.15 - CSV Download Fix
  - Ensured that CSV downloads for table data are sorted by column header order, regardless of what page you're on.

## Version 1.1.4 - Minor Improvements
  - Added option in Table and Pivot Table to choose whether numbers are rounded to a decimal place (and how many decimal places), similar to other charts and graphs
  - Fixed dropdown menu chevrons opening on click but not closing on click
  - Fixed an issue where empty datasets on the Comparison Line Chart would cause the download CSV button to spin forever

## Version 1.1.13 - Z-Index Fix
  - Fixed an issue where dropdown components were appearing behind other components in apps where more than one dashboard was embedded.

## Version 1.1.12 - Border Fix
  - Fixed an issue where borders on some charts and graphs were not displaying in builder mode (they were still displaying in the preview and on published dashboards).

## Version 1.1.11 - KPI Improvements
  - Allowed KPI charts to abbreviate long numbers (eg `1,200` to `1.2k`, `1,200,000` to `1.2m`,   etc). This change is backwards compatible, as it defaults to "false" in the KPI inputs.

## Version 1.1.10 - Minor Improvements
  - Added an option in the Table and Pivot Table components to remove Markdown links from data and just leave the text that was linked (eg `[Embeddable](https://embeddable.com)` becomes `Embeddable` in the CSV.
  - Fixed an issue where the dropdown options were not expanding to the same size as the dropdown itself, causing text to be unnecessarily cut off.

## Version 1.1.9 - CORS and Table Improvements
  - Ensured that all Google font `link` tags have `crossorigin="anonymous"` which should help with potential CORS issues is some setups
  - Table cells can now display arbitrary JSON. Includes a new setting to indicate whether cells should expand to show the entirety of the JSON value or clip it.

## Version 1.1.8 - Heat Grid, z-index, and replaceAll fixes
  - Fixed Heat Grid Sizing Issues (it will now scroll horizontally in small containers)
  - Moved all hard-coded z-index values in components to theme
  - Fixed an issue where `replaceAll` was sometimes being called on non-string values coming in from Dimensions, leading to error messages.

## Version 1.1.7 - Bug Fixes
  - Updated Bar Chart "limit" input to properly reflect the existing default
  - Fixed a bug that was causing the stacked area chart to render a blank canvas in certain circumstances

## Version 1.1.6 - Internal Fix

  - Fixed an internal issue relating to publishing to NPM.

## Version 1.1.5 - Custom Granularities

  - Added support for custom granularities via Cube.js data models. This means you can now add e.g. "Last 15 minutes" or "Last 18 days" as options in the Granularity Picker and Date Range Picker w/ Granularity components. You can find more instructions on the [Extending Types](/development/extending-types) documentation page.

## Version 1.1.4 - Fixes and a New Components

  - Improved theming of fonts on controls (eg dropdown)
  - Updated to latest SDKs
  - Fixed default sort not always applying on Pivot table
  - Added a new component: Heat Grid! It's a Github-style heatmap grid that can be used to visualize data over time.

<ImageGrid width='90%' images={["/img/heat-grid.png"]}/>

## Version 1.1.3 - Small Fixes
  - Fixed "default sort direction" on Table component not always being applied
  - Adjusted Pie Chart logic so that if "view as percentages" is on, and CSV data is downloaded, the CSV data will also display percentages
  - Added Aria labels and role descriptions to all charts to improve accessibility
  - Improved `null` value handling with Download Button component (all `null`, `undefined`, or `No Value` values are now empty cells in the resulting CSV)

## Version 1.1.1 & 1.1.2 - Bug Fixes
  - Fixed an issue where the "Next" button on Table Pagination was not working correctly in some instances.
  - Fixed an issue where in rare cases the Table Chart would crash when interpreting strings and getting a `null` value instead of an empty string.

## Version 1.1.0 - Automatic Granularity
  - Updates components to work with the new automatic granularity feature in the Embeddable SDK, which recognizes when time dimensions are used and automatically adds a granularity picker just below them. In order to keep this release backwards-compatible with existing dashboards, any components (such as Time Series Bar Chart) that previously used a dedicated granularity picker will continue to do so. However, new components and any components that did not previously include a granularity picker will use the automatic granularity picker by default.

## Version 1.022 - Dropdown sort
  - Adds the ability to sort the Dropdown and Multi-Select Dropdown components

## Version 1.0.21 - Download Menu
  - Significantly improved the ability to theme the Download Menu. You can find all of the new theme values in the [default theme file](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts) in the new `downloadMenu` section. This change may introduce very slight visual differences in the Download Menu, but it is not a breaking change. The default values remain the same, the menu is just more flexible now.

## Version 1.0.20 - Chart Label Theme Improvements
  - Improved the handling of chart labels, allowing users to theme labels on a per-chart-type basis. This is a non-breaking change, as the default values remain the same. You can see all of the new theme values in the [default theme file](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts).

## Version 1.0.19 - Table Improvements
  - Ensured that the normal and pivot tables both display boolean values as "True" or "False" instead of just a blank string.

## Version 1.0.18 - Chart Fix
  - Fixed an issue with the Bar Chart and displaying axis values.

## Version 1.0.17 - CSS and Bar charts
  - Moved several CSS items in [`index.css`](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/components/vanilla/index.css) to [new theme values](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts). This is a non-breaking change as all the values are set to the same values as before.
  - The Bar Chart now automatically includes a "Granularity" sub input when the X-Axis is a date, allowing users to choose between "Day", "Week", etc. If you leave it blank, the chart defaults to "yyyy-mm-dd", eliminating those long, ugly UTC strings.
