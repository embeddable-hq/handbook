# Styling

Remarkable Pro uses **CSS variables** (design tokens) that can be updated via the theme. 

Namespace: `theme.styles`

- `theme.styles` is a flat, strongly-typed list of style tokens that map to CSS values.  
- Only tokens defined in the underlying theme can be overridden.

**Example**

```tsx
const myTheme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
  styles: {
    '--em-background-color-default': 'f1f1f1',
    '--em-foreground-color-default': '#000',
    '--em-background-color-neutral': '#fff'
  }
}
```

## How CSS Variables are structured

Remarkable’s design system is built on three layers of tokens. You can override tokens at any layer, but each serves a different purpose.

### 1. Core variables

These are the raw design primitives:
- colour scales
- spacing scales
- typography scales
- shadows

You *can* override base variables if you’re building your own design system or want full control over the fundamentals. However, most teams leave the base layer alone and customise the higher layers instead. 

### 2. Semantic variables

These control global look & feel and are usually what you customise for brand identity:
- text colours
- surface/background colours
- borders

By default, role variables reference base variables.

### 3. Component variables

These apply to specific components (charts, cards, dropdowns, etc.).
They let you fine-tune details without affecting the entire system.

By default, component variables reference semantic variables (or base variables when appropriate).

### When to modify each

This layered structure keeps theming flexible and predictable. 

| **Variable type** | **When to use** |
| --- | --- |
| **Base** | When redefining the core design foundations (colours, spacing scale, typography scale, radii, shadows, motion). |
| **Semantic** | When applying branding across the entire product (global backgrounds, text colours, borders, accents, typography). |
| **Component** | When making targeted, isolated tweaks to a specific component (e.g. dropdown padding, card title colour). |
