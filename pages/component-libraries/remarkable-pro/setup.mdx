# Getting set up

It's quick and simple to get started with Remarkable Pro.

<Steps>

### Clone the Remarkable Pro Boilerplate Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate
```
This repo imports all the Remarkable Pro components and includes a ready-to-edit theme file, so you don’t need to assemble anything yourself.

### Follow the steps in the README

This prepares your repo and, optionally, enables you to test the components using your [local workspace](/development/local-environment). 

### Push the components to your Embeddable Workspace

Whenever you're ready, simply the [follow instructions here](/development/pushing-code#push-command) to push the components to your Workspace.

</Steps>

Alternatively, if you're getting set up for the first time, you can also follow our [Quick-start guide](/getting-started/quick-start-guide).
