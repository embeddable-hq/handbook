# Chart Colors

You can control chart colors globally via the [theme](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/theming).

Theme namespace: `theme.charts`

**Example:**

```tsx
// embeddable.theme.ts

backgroundColors?: string[]; // used for fills: bars, areas, pie/donut segments, etc.
borderColors?: string[]; // used for strokes: bar/area outlines, line strokes, segment borders

const myTheme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
  charts: {
    backgroundColors: ["#d2ecfd", "#a3d4fa", "#6bb7f5"],
    borderColors: ["#86bdf2", "#5aa1ef", "#2e82ea"] // slightly darker for definition
  }
}
```

**Notes**

- You can pass **any length** arrays; we’ll cycle if there are more categories than colors.
- Values can be **hex**, **rgb(a)**, **hsl(a)**, or **CSS variables**, e.g. "var(--em-chart-color-1)".
- If backgroundColors and borderColors are identical, borders will effectively disappear (this can be desirable for minimalist styles).
- If backgroundColors and borderColors are omitted, Remarkable Pro's default colors will apply. 

### Color assignment

- For charts where multiple categories/series are shown (e.g. **pie/donut**, **grouped/stacked bars**, **multi-line**), colors are **assigned to dimension values deterministically**. This means the same category label gets the same color across components (e.g. United States → always blue), improving cross-chart scanability.

- For charts that, by convention, use a **single color** (to emphasise shape, not category), colors are assigned to **measures**.This means the same measure gets the same color across components (e.g. Total USD → always green). Typical single-color cases:
    - Bar (one measure, one dimension)
    - Line (single series)
    - Area (single series)

### Cycling & overflow

- If your data has more unique values than colors in the array, we **cycle** through the palette in order.
- Best practice: provide enough colors to cover your expected maximum legend cardinality for a dashboard.

### Manual color assignment

For charts with a single color, you can select the color manually via the no-code builder. 

We will shortly enable you to manually assign colors to values for category charts too, via theming e.g. the value "positive" should always be green. 

## Practical tips

- **Dark/light themes:**
    Create **separate theme objects** (e.g. lightTheme, darkTheme) and swap them via [client-context](/getting-started/theme-components). Keep the **order** of colors identical across themes so value→color mapping stays consistent.
- **Colors per customer / tenant:** You can inject colors per user via client-context and merge them. If your theme expects separate fill/stroke arrays, map them explicitly:
        
```jsx
<em-beddable
    token="${json.token}"
    client-context='${JSON.stringify({
        colors: ["#555d8e", "#566f94", "#56819b"]
    })}'
></em-beddable>
```

```tsx
// embeddable.theme.ts

export const themeProvider = (clientContext: any, parentTheme: Theme): Theme => {
    const colors: string[] | undefined = clientContext?.colors;

    const overrides: DeepPartial<Theme> = colors
        ? { 
            charts: {
                backgroundColors: colors,     
            }
        } : {};

    return defineTheme(parentTheme, overrides) as Theme;
};
```
