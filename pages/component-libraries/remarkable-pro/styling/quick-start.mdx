# Quick start styling guide

<Pill>Takes ~5 mins</Pill>

Follow these steps to style Remarkable **for the first time**. 

We recommend spinning up your [local environment](/development/local-environment) while making these changes so you can see the impact of each adjustment in real time.

<Steps>

### Open your theme file

1. Open `embeddable.theme.ts` inside your repo. 
2. Add an empty `styles` object to a new or existing theme. 

```tsx
//embeddable.theme.ts

export const themeProvider = (clientContext: any, parentTheme: Theme): Theme => {

    const myTestStyles: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
        styles: {
            //your styles will go here
        }
    }

    return defineTheme(parentTheme, myTestStyles) as Theme;
};
```

### Set your text colors
These tokens control all major text roles across Remarkable. Replace the CSS values with your own. 

`'--em-sem-text': '#000'` 

- Updates primary text throughout the UI: titles, table text, dropdown labels, x-axis labels, KPI values, tooltip text, and icons.

`'--em-sem-text--muted': '#888'`  

-   Updates other text elements like descriptions, y-axis labels, legend categories, and subtle UI text.

```tsx
//theme.styles

styles: {
    `'--em-sem-text': '#000'`,
    `'--em-sem-text--muted': '#888'` 
}

```

### Set your background colours  

These tokens define the core surfaces used throughout the product.

`'--em-sem-background': '#fff'`

- Controls chart card backgrounds and many hover surfaces (e.g. table row hover, dropdown item hover).

`'--em-sem-background--neutral': '#ccc'`  

- Controls neutral surfaces such as SelectField triggers, dropdown panels, table-chart backgrounds, and chart-label values.

### Set your border radius
Adjust how rounded the UI should feel. You can set a single system-wide radius or tweak components individually.

`'--em-card-border-radius': '0px'`  

- Updates border radius for chart cards.

`'--em-selectfield-trigger-border-radius': '0px'`

`'--em-selectfield-content-border-radius': '0px'`  

- Updates SelectField buttons and dropdown panels.

</Steps>

## Example theme

Here's the example theme you might end up with after following the steps above. 

```tsx
//embeddable.theme.ts

export const themeProvider = (clientContext: any, parentTheme: Theme): Theme => {

    const myTestStyles: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
        styles: {
            '--em-sem-text': '#000' 
            '--em-sem-text--muted': '#888'  
            '--em-sem-background': '#fff'
            '--em-sem-background--neutral': '#ccc' 
            '--em-card-border-radius': '0px'  
            '--em-selectfield-trigger-border-radius': '0px'
            '--em-selectfield-content-border-radius': '0px'  
            '--em-core-font-family--base': 'Open Sans'
        }
    }

    return defineTheme(parentTheme, myTestStyles) as Theme;
};
```

## Refine individual components (when you're ready)

Once the basics are in place, you can start making more specific adjustments. Most teams do this gradually as they get familiar with the system.

A few tips to help you dig deeper:

- **Inspect elements in the browser** to see exactly which component tokens a UI part is using. This is the fastest way to learn what controls what.
- **Browse the [Component token lists](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-ui/blob/main/src/styles/global.css)** in the Remarkable UI repo to understand everything that can be customized for each component.
- **Use Storybook** (coming shortly) to preview components in isolation and test different styling overrides.
- **Refer to the Figma files** (coming shortly) for naming, hierarchy, and intended design behaviour—Figma and the token structure are tightly aligned.

With these tools, you can fine-tune styles on a per-component basis and get as granular as you need, without losing the consistency provided by your broader theme.
