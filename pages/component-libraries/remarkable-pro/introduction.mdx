# Remarkable Pro

Remarkable Pro is Embeddable’s new, production-ready component suite. 

It gives you both **beautiful defaults** and **developer-level extensibility**. It’s designed for teams that want world-class customer-facing analytics with speed, polish, and complete control.

Remarkable includes:
- **All core visualisations**: bar, line, pie/donut, KPI tiles, tables, heatmaps, etc.
- **All essential controls**: dropdowns, multi-selects, date pickers (UTC-safe), and custom filters.
- **In-built interactivity**: every chart supports *click to filter*.
- **i18n**: internationalisation, built-in.
- **Consistent colors**: automatic color-value assignment. And lots more.

## Key benefits

What makes Remarkable Pro stand out:

### Precision styling
  - Everything is powered by **CSS variables**.
  - Brand-safe theming with complete control over colors, typography, spacing, shadows, borders, and interaction states.
  - Automatic color-value assignment across charts and dashboards. 

### Full extensibility
  - Easily override key behaviour, presets, and logic.
    - e.g. add new export options.
    - e.g. change how date periods are calculated.
    - e.g. pass in new table-cell renderers.
  - Build your own charts using the same underlying building blocks we've created to build Remarkable Pro.

### Internationalisation and localisation
  - Easy integration with translation systems.
  - Locale-aware currency, numbers, and dates.
  - Timezone-safe throughout (UTC internally, localised for display).

### Built for growth and maintainability
  - Strong TypeScript types.
  - Consistent patterns across the entire system.
  - Optimised for **large datasets** and high-frequency updates.
  - Designed to scale with your needs - from quick out-of-the-box charts to fully custom components built from Remarkable UI primitives.
