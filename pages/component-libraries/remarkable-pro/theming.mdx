# Getting started with theming

Once you’ve got the boilerplate running, the best place to begin is the **theme file**: 

`embeddable.theme.ts`

This is where you shape how Remarkable **looks**, **behaves**, and **aligns with your product’s design system**.

Open `embeddable.theme.ts` and you’ll find a small starter theme. It’s intentionally simple - just enough to show the structure without getting in your way - and you can grow it piece by piece as you go.

Everything you can change is covered in the documentation, and because the entire system is strongly typed, you can always inspect the types to discover exactly what’s available.

### Example theme

```ts
const themeProvider = (clientContext: any, parentTheme: Theme): Theme => {

    const myTheme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
        charts: {
            backgroundColors: [
                'rgb(75, 134, 255)',
                'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
                'rgb(255, 205, 86)',
                'rgb(54, 162, 235)',
                'rgb(153, 102, 255)',
                'rgb(255, 159, 64)',
            ],
        },
        styles: {
            '--em-background-color-default': 'rgb(196 49 196)',
            '--em-foreground-color-default': 'rgb(0 181 60)',
        },
    };

    const theme = defineTheme(parentTheme, newTheme) as Theme;
    return theme;
};

export default themeProvider;
```

While **Remarkable’s theme has its own shape**, the *mechanics* of theming (e.g. `themeProvider` and the `defineTheme` helper) come from **Embeddable’s general theming system**. You can read more about it [here](/development/theming).


You're able to create multiple themes and switch between them. Many teams use:
- a light and dark mode  
- separate themes for demos or internal environments.
- a dedicated theme per customer  

It's worth nothing, when you create a theme, you’re **not building everything from scratch**. Remarkable ships with a **full set of defaults** - colours, styles, chart behaviour, i18n, and more. That’s why the theme uses `defineTheme(parentTheme, newTheme)` - it merges your overrides with the built-in defaults, giving you a clean, predictable way to extend only what you need.

## Next step

A good first step is to define your chart colours - it’s quick, visual, and immediately makes the system feel like *yours*.
