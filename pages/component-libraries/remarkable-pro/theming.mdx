# Getting started with theming

The theme is where you shape Remarkable Pro. 

It lives in your repo, inside `embeddable.theme.ts` and is your control panel for branding, styling, internationalisation, and the global options that power your analytics experience.

You can create **multiple themes** and switch between them. Many teams use:
- a light and dark mode.
- separate themes for demos or internal environments.
- a dedicated theme per customer.

**Example theme**

```ts

//embeddable.theme.ts

const themeProvider = (clientContext: any, parentTheme: Theme): Theme => {

    const myTheme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
        charts: {
            backgroundColors: [
                'rgb(75, 134, 255)',
                'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
                'rgb(255, 205, 86)',
                'rgb(54, 162, 235)',
                'rgb(153, 102, 255)',
                'rgb(255, 159, 64)',
            ],
        },
        styles: {
            '--em-background-color-default': 'rgb(196 49 196)',
            '--em-foreground-color-default': 'rgb(0 181 60)',
        },
    };

    const theme = defineTheme(parentTheme, myTheme) as Theme;
    return theme;
};

export default themeProvider;
```

**Things to notice**
- While **Remarkable’s theme has its own shape**, the *mechanics* of theming (e.g. `themeProvider` and the `defineTheme` helper) come from Embeddable’s general [theming system](/development/theming).
- Remarkable ships with a **full set of defaults**. That’s why the theme uses `defineTheme(parentTheme, newTheme)` - it merges your overrides with the built-in parent theme, giving you a clean way to extend only what you need.
- You can pass **dynamic values** via  to your theme at run-time via **Client Context** (e.g. client-specific colors, or the name of a theme to apply), as well as create presets for testing in the builder. [Learn more here](/getting-started/theme-components).
- The `themeProvider` has one job: take the incoming client context and decide which values to apply to the theme.


## Where to start

The best place to start is to **define your brand colors**. These will be used inside all your charts.

## Theming vs Builder Customizations 

Remarkable Pro components come with a large set of **functional** options that are configured in the **Builder**, not in your theme. Understanding this split makes theming much clearer:

- **Theme** → generally, the global appearance, branding, localisation, and logic. 
- **Builder** → generally, the configuration for a specific chart on one of your dashboards. 

### In the Builder, you control things like:
- which data to display.
- whether to show legends, tooltips, and other UI elements. 
- the max number of categories for grouped charts.
- formatting rules (prefix, suffix, currency, rounding, abbreviations, date granularity, etc.)

### In the theme, you control things like:
- global styling for the entire dashboard. 
- the options available across components, and how they’re calculated (e.g. export options, date-range presets, comparison ranges).
- translations and locale-aware formatting.
- chart-specific overrides and fine-grained component styling.  

Together, the Theme and the Builder let you customise how your analytics both **look and behave**.
