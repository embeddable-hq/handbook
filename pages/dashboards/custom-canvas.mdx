# Custom Canvas

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  **Custom Canvas** will become Generally Available to all customers in November 2025
</Callout>

**Custom Canvas** lets your users go beyond static dashboards and **create their own dashboards** directly **inside your product**. You define the datasets, chart templates, and rules. They **create, customize** and **explore** the data to assemble a **self-serve custom canvas** that **fits their workflow**, without ever leaving your application.

## What can you build?

Common **use cases** of **Custom Canvas** include:

1. **Primary analytics dashboard** that can be easily extended by your customers.
2. **‚ÄúCreate dashboard‚Äù button** that allows customers to build and save as many dashboards in your platform as they like.
3. **Team dashboards**, shared across multiple users, where some have edit permissions and others are just viewers.

This page will talk you through:
- What **Custom Canvas** looks like for your **end-users**.
- How to choose which **datasets**, **dimensions** and **measures** should be available to your end-users.
- How to choose (and customize) the **charts, tables** and **components** that your end-users can use to **build their dashboards**.

## The value for your end-users

With **Custom Canvas**, your users don‚Äôt just consume dashboards‚Äîthey create dashboards that fit them.

 - **Personalized insights, faster** ‚Üí Users build dashboards around the questions they care about, without waiting on engineering or analyst teams.

 - **Freedom within guardrails** ‚Üí You define the datasets, metrics, and chart types, while they explore and customize with confidence.

 - **Seamless, scalable experience** ‚Üí Dashboards live inside your app, feel native, and grow with users‚Äô needs‚Äîfrom a quick chart to a full reporting hub.

By empowering your **end-users** to help themselves to exactly what they need, you‚Äôre saving your own teams the time and effort of continuously building custom reports.

Embeddable also handles the rest:
- **Row-level security** so that each end-user only sees the data they‚Äôre allowed to see ([learn more](/data-modeling/row-level-security)).
- **Theming**, **internationalisation** and **timezone support** can be applied so it feels like a native part of your platform experience.
- The **dashboard state** for every custom dashboard is automatically stored and restored for your end-users when they make changes and later return, meaning ‚Äúit just works‚Äù as soon as it's deployed ([learn more](/deployment/custom-canvas)).

## The end-user experience

<Steps>

### Start with a blank canvas

Your users begin with a **clean, empty workspace** that feels flexible and approachable. From here, they can create dashboards that reflect their unique priorities.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/start-building.png"]} width="100%" />

### **Use pre-built templates**

You can provide a **library of pre-configured dashboard templates** tailored to common use cases. Users simply select one and begin customizing immediately.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/select-a-template.png"]} width="100%" />

### Build charts with guided inputs

Each chart is powered by the data fields you choose to make available. Users **select measures or dimensions**, and a **live preview** updates once the required inputs are complete. This strikes a balance between **flexibility for them** and **control for you**.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/build-your-chart.png"]} width="100%" />

### Create multi-chart dashboards

Users can add, arrange, and resize as many charts as they need that tell the story of their data.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/multi-charts.png"]} width="100%" />

### Combine Custom Canvas and fixed content

Sometimes you want to set context. Custom Canvas supports **hybrid dashboards**, where you can fix key charts, metrics, or explanatory text at the top‚Äîwhile still allowing users to build their own canvas beneath.

</Steps>

## How you build it

**Custom Canvas** is designed to give your users flexibility‚Äîwhile keeping you, the builder, fully in control of the datasets, templates, and rules they can use. Here‚Äôs how you set it up.

<Steps>

### Activate Custom Canvas

Turn on **Custom Canvas** by using the toggle beneath your main canvas. This opens up configuration options specific to user-created dashboards.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/custom-canvas-button.png"]} width="100%" />

### Select Available Datasets

In the **Datasets section**, select which datasets your users should be able to access.

- Datasets available to your users are highlighted in bright purple.
- This makes it easy to distinguish between data powering your **main dashboards** and the data you want to expose for **user exploration**.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/custom-canvas-datasets.png"]} width="100%" />

Your data team can apply fine-grained control over what [dimensions and measures](/data-modeling/dimensions-and-measures) are available to end-users using [Views](/data-modeling/views) and [Access Policies](/data-modeling/access-policies).

### Build a Library of Templates

Next, go to the **Template Library tab** to create reusable templates. These come from [your existing component library](/dashboards/starter-components) (e.g., pie chart, donut chart, bar chart).

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/custom-canvas-templates.png"]} width="100%" />

Start by selecting a chart from your component library

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/custom-canvas-add-template.png"]} width="100%" />

### Configure Chart Inputs

Define the fields your users will interact with when creating their charts:

- **Pre-populate fields** for a guided experience.
- **Leave fields empty** to give users freedom.
- **Hide fields** entirely to keep complexity out of sight.

This balance lets you control how much flexibility users have.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/configure-a-template.png"]} width="100%" />

### Name and Describe Templates

Give each template:

- A **name**
- An optional **description**
- A **distinctive icon**

This helps users easily differentiate between chart types when building dashboards.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/name-your-template.png"]} width="100%" />

### Manage and Organize Templates

All configured templates appear on your **dashboard builder page**, below your main dashboard.  
 - Add as many templates as you like.  
 - Manage templates easily using the on-hover controls.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/manage-and-organise.png"]} width="100%" />

### Preview and Publish

When you‚Äôre ready, **Preview** the user experience to ensure everything looks and feels right. Then simply hit **Publish** to make Custom Canvas live for your users.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/custom-canvas/preview.png"]} width="100%" />
