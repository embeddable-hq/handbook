# Custom Canvas

Custom canvas is a **future feature** that will enable your end-users to customize their own dashboards: configuring charts from scratch or selecting from a library of ready-made insights you've created for them. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/custom-canvas-demo.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="888"
/>

### What to Expect

- **Personalized Layout**: Let individuals arrange, resize, or add components according to their needs.
- **No Extra Dev Work**: Embeddable handles the underlying logic, so you simply embed the Custom Canvas page, and your users get a straightforward builder experience.
- **Secure & Scoped**: Decide which components or data models each user can access, ensuring no one sees data they shouldnâ€™t.

Stay tuned for updates.
