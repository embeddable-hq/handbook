# Custom Canvas

Custom canvas is a feature that enables your end-users to customize their own dashboards: configuring charts from scratch or selecting from a library of ready-made insights you've created for them.

### What to Expect

- **Personalized Layout**: Let individuals arrange, resize, or add components according to their needs.
- **No Extra Dev Work**: Embeddable handles the underlying logic, so you simply embed the Custom Canvas page, and your users get a straightforward builder experience.
- **Secure & Scoped**: Decide which components or data models each user can access, ensuring no one sees data they shouldnâ€™t.

###Version 1: Live!
Version 1 of this feature allows you to display a menu of charts to users that they can add to their dashboard. They can then add, remove and reorder. This feature enables you to offer a library/menu of charts that your end-users might want to add to their dashboards. Once they save their configuration, the config/state can be saved for next time they come back.

###Version 2: Coming soon
Version 2 will enable your end-users to create completely new charts by combining chart types with their own data and input configuration. You have full control over which datasets and modification options are available to your end users, and they have full control to customise their dashboard within the guardrails you provide to them.
