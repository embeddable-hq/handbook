# Publishing Your Dashboard

There are two ways to publish your dashboards:

- **Publish button**: The [Publish button](/dashboards/publishing#using-the-publish-button) in the no-code builder allows you to publish saved dashboard versions directly to **development**, **staging** and **production**.
- **Saved versions**: If you don't see a Publish button, that is because your workspace is set up to publish using [Saved versions](/deployment/versions). For this flow, save a version and pass the saved version to your engineering team so it can be promoted through their development workflow.

## Using the Publish Button

The **Publish** button allows you to publish your saved dashboard versions directly to **development**, **staging** or **production**.

The Publish button brings up a dialog that is split into two columns:

- **Saved Versions**: The left-hand column lists the last 30 saved versions of the dashboard. You can select a version to publish to any of the 3 environments. To create a new version, see [Saving Versions](/dashboards/saving).
- **Info and Action**: The right-hand column lists the **Model**, **Component**, and **Cube** versions of the currently selected saved version. It also allows you to choose where to publish to. Publish tags that the saved version is _already published to_ are disabled, while those that are not are selectable.

The right-hand column also includes the **Publish button** itself, and a link with additional information on [How to embed your dashboard](/deployment/embedding). The Publish button will only be enabled if you have selected at least one publish tag to publish to.

## Rolling Back Changes

To roll back Production (or any tag):

  1. Open the Publish modal.

  2. Select the prior saved version.

  3. Check Production and click Publish (The tag moves back to the chosen version and is effective immediately).

## Next Steps

Once you've published your dashboard, you can [Embed it in your application](/deployment/embedding) to make it available to your users.
