# Publishing Your Dashboard

There are two ways to publish your dashboard:

- **Publish button**: If you want to empower your dashboard users to publish their own changes, you can enable the **Publish** button in the no-code builder. This allows them to push updates directly to the live environment.
- **Saved versions via the API**: For more controlled deployments, you can use the **Saved versions** feature. This lets you create specific dashboard versions that can be promoted through your development workflow.

## Using the Publish Button

When you enable the **Publish** button, users can click it to push their current dashboard state live. This includes all components, models, and configurations they have set up in the no-code builder. Users can publish to the **Development**, **Staging**, or **Production** environments, or any combination, depending on your workspace settings.

In order to enable the Publish button, you must have at least one of the **Development**, **Staging**, or **Production** tags enabled in your workspace. This ensures users can publish to at least one environment.

The Publish button brings up a dialog that is split into two sections:

- **Saved Versions**: The left-hand column lists the last thirty saved versions of the dashboard. Users can select a version to publish to any of the three environments. To create a new version, see [Saving Versions](/dashboards/saving).
- **Info and Action Pane**: The right-hand column lists the **Model**, **Component**, and **Cube** versions of the currently selected saved version. It also allows the user to choose which environments to publish to. Environments that the version is _already published to_ are greyed out, while those that are not are selectable.

The **Info and Action Pane** also includes the **Publish button** itself, and a link with additional information on [How to embed your dashboard](/deployment/embedding). The Publish button will only be enabled if the user has selected at least one environment to publish to.

## Rolling Back Changes

To roll back Production (or any tag):
<Steps>
  ### Open Publish versions.

  ### Select the prior saved version.

  ### Check Production and click Publish.
 
  The tag moves back to the chosen version and is effective immediately.
</Steps>

## When to use Publish vs Tokens
- **Publish button**: Empower your dashboard builders to promote versions without code changes. As soon as they're happy with their dashboard, they can publish it.

- **API with `savedVersion`**: Publish your dashboard through code/PRs and CI/CD. See [Deploying Dashboard Versions](/deployment/versions) for details.

## Once your Dashboard is Published

- **Embed the Dashboard**: Your engineering need to follow the simple instructions [here](/deployment/embedding).
- **Iterate Anytime**: Once it's embedded, you can make edits any time and push them live. Return to the no-code builder, adjust your components or data, and publish again.

## Next Steps

Once you've published your dashboard, you can [Embed it in your application](/deployment/embedding) to make it available to your users.
