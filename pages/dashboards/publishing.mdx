# Publishing Your Dashboard

When your dashboard is ready to ship, simply hit the **publish** button. This finalizes your changes so you can:

- **Embed the Dashboard**: Your engineering need to follow the simple instructions [here](/deployment/embedding).
- **Iterate Anytime**: Once it's embedded, you can make edits any time and push them live. Return to the no-code builder, adjust your components or data, and publish again.

## A Native Look and Feel

Embeddable dashboards appear on your site through a **web component** (`<em-beddable>`). This approach offers:

- **Seamless Integration**: The web component behaves like any native HTML element, so your dashboard feels right at home in your layout.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Automatic breakpoints and scaling help your dashboards adapt to smaller screens without extra effort.
- **Flexible Branding**: Any theming you’ve applied (e.g., custom colors) comes through naturally, since the canvas is invisible and won’t override your site’s look.

By design, visitors can’t tell they’re viewing something “external” - it looks and behaves like a **built-in** part of your website.
