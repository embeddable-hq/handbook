# Saving Dashboard Versions

When you‚Äôre building a dashboard, it‚Äôs important to save your work regularly. The no-code builder has two main ways to save your progress: **Auto‚ÄëSave** protects your work as you edit. **Saving a version** lets you commit a known good state, add context, and reuse or promote that exact state later.

## How Saving Works

### Auto-Save

This occurs automatically whenever you make changes. Your latest dashboard state is **always** saved, even if you close the browser or lose connection.

If you decide you want to revert any changes you've made that were auto-saved, you can choose to revert to a previous **Saved version** in the [version picker](/dashboards/saving#choosing-versions).

### Manual Save

You can click the **Save Version** button at the top of the dashboard builder to create a specific version. These versions persist, so you can switch back and forth between them and also, crucially, publish them (potentially to different environments).

Saved versions record which **Models**, **Components**, and **Cube** versions were used. This guarantees reproducible deploys and reliable rollbacks. They also include an optional description field, so you can document what changed or why you saved that version.

### Effects on other parts of the platform

The version you save can be selected in the **Saved versions picker**, promoted to Development/Staging/Production via the **Publish flow**, targeted via the **Tokens API** (`savedVersion`), included in Embeddable's **API metadata**, and used by the **Caching API** when refreshing pre‚Äëaggregations.

## Saving a version

Clicking the **Save Version** button opens the following dialog:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/dashboard-versions-save.png"]} width="50%" />

It contains the following information:

- **Description**: A text field where you can enter a brief summary of what changes were made in this version. This appears wherever that saved version is listed. Examples: ‚ÄúAdd cohort filter‚Äù, ‚ÄúSwap source to v2 model‚Äù.
- **Models version**: information on the currently-selected Models version, including the date and message from the last models publish.
- **Components version**: information on the currently-selected Components version, including the date and message from the last components publish.
- **Cube version**: information on the currently-selected Cube version.

You can change your models/components/cube version by quitting out of the dialog, selecting the version you want to use from the dropdowns at the top of the dashboard builder, and then clicking **Save Version** again.

After saving succeeds, we show the following confirmation dialog:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/dashboard-versions-save-success.png"]} width="50%" />

This shows you the **version number**, allows you to publish this version, and gives information on how to Embed this version in your site.

## Choosing Versions

The versions picker at the top of the dashboard builder allows you to select versions of your dashboard, models, components, and Cube.js. This lets you quickly switch between different states of your dashboard.

### Saved versions

Saved versions are listed in the dropdown, with the most recent at the top. You can select any saved version to load it into the builder. Note that if you have not saved your most recent changes, you will be prompted to confirm before switching, as doing so will overwrite them.

This picker also shows the **description** entered when saving the version, the **date** it was saved, **who** saved it, whether it is the **currently selected** version being used by the dashboard builder, and whether it is **currently published** to the development, staging, or production environments.

When you change dashboard versions, we also update the **Models**, **Components**, and **Cube** pickers to match what that saved version used. Note that you can switch your dashboard version without impacting published statuses (the "selected" tag will move).

<ImageGrid images={["/img/versions-dashboard.png", "/img/versions-dashboard-selected.png"]} />

If a referenced Cube version is no longer available, we'll surface a clear warning and guide you to select a compatible version before you save or publish again.

### Models version

The Models version picker shows the currently selected Models version, along with the date and message from the last models publish. You can switch to a different version by selecting it from the dropdown.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/versions-models.png","/img/versions-models-selected.png"]} />

### Components version

The Components version picker shows the currently selected Components version, along with the date and message from the last components publish. You can switch to a different version by selecting it from the dropdown.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/versions-components.png","/img/versions-components-selected.png"]} />

### Cube version

The Cube version picker shows the currently selected Cube version, along with the date and message from the last Cube.js publish. You can switch to a different version by selecting it from the dropdown.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/versions-cube.png","/img/versions-cube-selected.png"]} />

## Top Bar layout

We‚Äôve separated the toolbar into two groups for clarity:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/topbar.png"]} />

- **Left**: Logo, Title, View as, Preview toggle.
- **Right**: Versions dropdown, Save version, Publish.

## Workspace tag availability

Workspaces can enable any combination of **Development**, **Staging**, and **Production** tags. If your workspace disables all tags, **Publish** actions are hidden.

## Next Steps

Once you've saved a version of your dashboard, you're ready to [publish it](/dashboards/publishing) to your desired environments.
