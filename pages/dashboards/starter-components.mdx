# Starter Components

Embeddable comes with a **starter library** of ready-to-use components - like charts, tables, and controls. 

You can easily **theme** or **customize** them to fit your brand and data needs.

We’ll soon add a dedicated section here to showcase these in more detail - stay tuned!
