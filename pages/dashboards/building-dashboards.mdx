# Building Dashboards

In Embeddable’s no-code builder, **two primary building blocks** form the basis of every dashboard: 
- **Datasets**: the data you want to show. 
- **Components**: your charting visualizations.   

By mixing and matching them on the canvas you can quickly create powerful, reusable dashboards.

## Datasets

**Datasets** are simply a named **data model** with optional **filters** applied. For example, you might have:
- A **Customers** dataset based on your `customers` data model.
- A **High-Spend Customers** dataset that applies a filter on the `customers` model.
- An **Orders** dataset based on an `orders` data model. 

You **define a dataset** in the Embeddable no-code builder by clicking the [+] in the Datasets section in the bottom right.

  Because data models include [row-level security rules](/data-modeling/row-level-security) and transformations, everyone sees the right data automatically, so this **isn't something you need to consider** in the no-code builder.

## Components

Components are **visual or interactive elements** - charts, tables, dropdowns, text blocks, etc. - that your dev team has pushed to Embeddable. For each component, the builder will:

- **Prompt for Inputs**: Such as which dimension to use along the x-axis, or the title.
- **No-code**: No code is needed in the builder. You just fill in the fields.

## The Canvas

When you add or reposition components, Embeddable’s **canvas** automatically arranges them based on a *12-column grid layout** with a few key properties:

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Move any component around, and the canvas will slot it into the nearest open space.
- **Upwards Gravity**: If there’s empty space above a component, it will shift upward automatically.
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: The canvas adapts for mobile or smaller screens: 12 columns on desktop and 1 column on mobile (these breakpoints currently **can’t** be edited).
- **No CSS Overrides**: The layout engine isn’t controlled by your CSS. Instead, it’s managed within Embeddable to ensure consistent placement across devices.

This lets you focus on **what** goes into your dashboard rather than fussing with positioning details or media queries.
