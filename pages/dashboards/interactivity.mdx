# Interactivity with Variables

Embeddableâ€™s **variables** make dashboards interactive - so when you change something in one part of the dashboard, it can automatically update another.

## How it works:

<Steps>

### **A user performs an action**  
   - For instance, you type in a text box, click a button, or select a value from a dropdown.

### **A Variable gets updated**  
   - The dashboard saves what you typed or clicked inside a variable. 
   - Some components [create variables automatically](/development/interactivity#usage-flow-1) when you add them to the Canvas, but you can also create variables manually. 

### **Any connected components and datasets update too**  
   - If a variable is connected to a dataset filter, or an input within a component, it will update, causing the data to reload or the component to change in some way. 

</Steps>

Itâ€™s like magic, but actually just smart automation behind the scenes! ðŸš€

## Examples

### A simple search input

Here's how to create a simple search input that filters a dataset, like so:

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/simple-text-filter.mp4"
    width="1780"
    height="998"
/>
