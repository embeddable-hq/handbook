# Interactivity with Variables

Embeddable’s **variables** make dashboards interactive - so when you change something in one part of the dashboard, it can automatically update another.

## How it works:

<Steps>

### **A user performs an action**  
   - e.g. type in a text box, click a button, or select a value from a dropdown.

### **A Variable gets updated**  
   - The dashboard saves what you typed or clicked inside a variable. 
   - Some components [create variables automatically](/development/interactivity#usage-flow-1) when you add them to the Canvas, but you can also create variables manually. 

### **Any connected components and datasets update too**  
   - If a variable is connected to a dataset filter, or an input within a component, it will update, causing the data to reload or the component to change in some way. 

</Steps>

It’s like magic, but actually just smart automation behind the scenes! 🚀

## Example: A simple search input

Here's how to create a simple search input that filters a dataset like so:

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/simple-text-filter.mp4"
    width="1780"
    height="998"
/>

<Steps>

### Add a Text Input component

- Optionally, in the Text Input's Edit panel, set a **placeholder** text like “Type here to search.”

### A "Text Value" variable is created automatically

- Each time the user types, the component fires an event that updates this variable.

### Connect the variable to the dataset

1. Open the settings of the **dataset** you wish to filter (in the bottom right).
2. Click **Add filter**.  
3. Select the dimension or field you want to filter on (e.g. “Country”).  
4. Choose **“equals”** or **“contains”** and link it to the variable by clicking the **link** icon on the right.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/how-to-add-simple-filter.mp4"
    width="1780"
    height="998"
/>

### See It in Action

- Switch to **Preview** mode by switching the preview toggle in the top menu.  
- Type a **keyword** into the text input.  
- Embeddable **updates the variable**, which automatically **refreshes the dataset**, showing only matching rows.  
- Any chart or table connected to that dataset now displays filtered data in real time!

</Steps>

**Result**: A quick, code-free **search** feature across your dashboard, powered by a single text input and a variable-based filter.

## Example: Click a pie chart 'segment' to filter data

Here's how to filter data when a user clicks the segment of a pie chart.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/4-preview-interaction.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

<Steps>

### **Create a Variable**  
   - Since adding the pie chart doesn’t automatically generate a variable for this type of interaction, you’ll add one yourself. 
   - Click the **+ icon** on the right, give your variable a **name** (e.g. **country**), and select a **type** (simply `text` in this case). 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/1-create-variable.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

### **Set Up the Pie Chart Interaction**  
   - Click edit on the pie chart.  
   - Under **Interactions**, connect the click event to your new variable and then click Done.
   - Now, whenever someone clicks a slice, the chart fires an event, and Embeddable updates the **country** variable. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/2-create-interaction.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

### **Apply the Variable to a Dataset Filter**  
   - In your dataset settings, add a new filter:  
     - Choose the dimension (e.g., Country) you want to match.  
     - Set it to “equals” (or “contains,” depending on your need).  
     - Link it to the **country** variable.  
   - This way, the dataset only loads rows that match the user’s chosen slice.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/3-link-dataset-filter.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

### **Test the Flow**  
   - Switch to **Preview** mode.  
   - Click any pie slice: **country** updates, causing the dataset to reload with that slice’s data.  
   - Any chart or table using this dataset also updates automatically.

</Steps>

## Example: Switch Date Grouping with a Granularity Picker

Here's how to let viewers toggle a chart between **daily**, **weekly**, or **monthly** views.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/granularity-preview.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="788"
/>

<Steps>

### **Add a Granularity Picker Component**

    - Drop the **Daterange Picker** onto your canvas. You could also add the **Granularity Picker**.
    - A "granularity" variable is created automatically. Each time the user selects a granularity, it will update the **granularity** variable. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/add-granularity-picker.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="938"
/>

### Link the variable to the granularity input in your chart

- In your time-series chart, you'll find a **granularity** input.  
- This should already have a value selected in the dropdown (e.g. "week").
- Click the link icon on the right, select your **granularity** variable, and click **Done**. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/hook-up-granularity.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="938"
/>

### **Sit back, and enjoy the ride**

- Switch to **Preview** mode and click different granularity options.
- Watch your chart instantly switch between day, week, or month. 

</Steps>

## Setting Default Values

You can set a default variable value that applies when the dashboard first loads. Simple:

1. **Open the Variable Builder**  
   - In the right-hand panel of the builder, select (or create) a variable.
2. **Assign a Default**  
   - In the “Value” field, pick or type the initial value (e.g., “USA” for a Country variable, or “week” for a granularity).

### Passing Variables via Code

If certain values are **customer-specific** (like “United States” for one client and “Germany” for another), you can also [**provide variables programmatically**](/deployment/embedding#interacting-with-your-embeddable) when embedding the dashboard in your site. This ensures each user sees the right default context without manually picking it.

## Variable types

Each variable is defined with a **type** - like `text`, `time`, or `number`. When you link a variable to an input or dataset filter, both sides must share a **matching type**. For instance, you can’t connect a **number** input to a **text** variable.

**Note**: In the future, we plan to offer more flexibility around how different types can interact.
