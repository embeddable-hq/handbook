# Interactivity with Variables

Embeddable‚Äôs **variables** make dashboards interactive - so when you change something in one part of the dashboard, it can automatically update another.

## How it works:

<Steps>

### **A user performs an action**  
   - e.g. type in a text box, click a button, or select a value from a dropdown.

### **A Variable gets updated**  
   - The dashboard saves what you typed or clicked inside a variable. 
   - Some components [create variables automatically](/development/interactivity#usage-flow-1) when you add them to the Canvas, but you can also create variables manually. 

### **Any connected components and datasets update too**  
   - If a variable is connected to a dataset filter, or an input within a component, it will update, causing the data to reload or the component to change in some way. 

</Steps>

It‚Äôs like magic, but actually just smart automation behind the scenes! üöÄ

## Example: A simple search input

Here's how to create a simple search input that filters a dataset like so:

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/simple-text-filter.mp4"
    width="1780"
    height="998"
/>

<Steps>

### Add a Text Input component

- Optionally, in the Text Input's Edit panel, set a **placeholder** text like ‚ÄúType here to search.‚Äù

### A "Text Value" variable is created automatically

- Each time the user types, the component fires an event that updates this variable.

### Connect the variable to the dataset

1. Open the settings of the **dataset** you wish to filter (in the bottom right).
2. Click **Add filter**.  
3. Select the dimension or field you want to filter on (e.g. ‚ÄúCountry‚Äù).  
4. Choose **‚Äúequals‚Äù** or **‚Äúcontains‚Äù** and link it to the variable by clicking the **link** icon on the right.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/how-to-add-simple-filter.mp4"
    width="1780"
    height="998"
/>

### See It in Action

- Switch to **Preview** mode by switching the preview toggle in the top menu.  
- Type a **keyword** into the text input.  
- Embeddable **updates the variable**, which automatically **refreshes the dataset**, showing only matching rows.  
- Any chart or table connected to that dataset now displays filtered data in real time!

</Steps>

**Result**: A quick, code-free **search** feature across your dashboard, powered by a single text input and a variable-based filter.

## Example: Click a pie chart 'segment' to filter data

Here's how to filter data when a user clicks the segment of a pie chart.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/4-preview-interaction.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

<Steps>

### **Create a Variable**  
   - Since adding the pie chart doesn‚Äôt automatically generate a variable for this type of interaction, you‚Äôll add one yourself. 
   - Click the **+ icon** on the right, give your variable a **name** (e.g. **country**), and select a **type** (simply `text` in this case). 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/1-create-variable.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

### **Set Up the Pie Chart Interaction**  
   - Click edit on the pie chart.  
   - Under **Interactions**, connect the click event to your new variable and then click Done.
   - Now, whenever someone clicks a slice, the chart fires an event, and Embeddable updates the **country** variable. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/2-create-interaction.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

### **Apply the Variable to a Dataset Filter**  
   - In your dataset settings, add a new filter:  
     - Choose the dimension (e.g., Country) you want to match.  
     - Set it to ‚Äúequals‚Äù (or ‚Äúcontains,‚Äù depending on your need).  
     - Link it to the **country** variable.  
   - This way, the dataset only loads rows that match the user‚Äôs chosen slice.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/3-link-dataset-filter.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="846"
/>

### **Test the Flow**  
   - Switch to **Preview** mode.  
   - Click any pie slice: **country** updates, causing the dataset to reload with that slice‚Äôs data.  
   - Any chart or table using this dataset also updates automatically.

</Steps>

## Example: Switch Date Grouping with a Granularity Picker

Here's how to let viewers toggle a chart between **daily**, **weekly**, or **monthly** views.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/granularity-preview.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="788"
/>

<Steps>

### **Add a Granularity Picker Component**

    - Drop the **Daterange Picker** onto your canvas. You could also add the **Granularity Picker**.
    - A "granularity" variable is created automatically. Each time the user selects a granularity, it will update the **granularity** variable. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/add-granularity-picker.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="938"
/>

### Link the variable to the granularity input in your chart

- In your time-series chart, you'll find a **granularity** input.  
- This should already have a value selected in the dropdown (e.g. "week").
- Click the link icon on the right, select your **granularity** variable, and click **Done**. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/hook-up-granularity.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="938"
/>

### **Sit back, and enjoy the ride**

- Switch to **Preview** mode and click different granularity options.
- Watch your chart instantly switch between day, week, or month. 

</Steps>

## Setting Default Values

You can set a default variable value that applies when the dashboard first loads. Simple:

1. **Open the Variable Builder**  
   - In the right-hand panel of the builder, select (or create) a variable.
2. **Assign a Default**  
   - In the ‚ÄúValue‚Äù field, pick or type the initial value (e.g., ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù for a Country variable, or ‚Äúweek‚Äù for a granularity).

### Passing Variables via Code

If certain values are **customer-specific** (like ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù for one client and ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù for another), you can also [**provide variables programmatically**](/deployment/embedding#interacting-with-your-embeddable) when embedding the dashboard in your site. This ensures each user sees the right default context without manually picking it.

## Variable types

Each variable is defined with a **type** - like `text`, `time`, or `number`. When you link a variable to an input or dataset filter, both sides must share a **matching type**. For instance, you can‚Äôt connect a **number** input to a **text** variable.

**Note**: In the future, we plan to offer more flexibility around how different types can interact.

## Dimensions and Measures as Variables

You can also use **dimensions** and **measures** as variables. This is useful for components that need to filter data based on user selections, like a dropdown that lets users pick a dimension or measure to display.

In order to facilitate this behavior, we provide six predefined picker components in [our starter library](/dashboards/starter-components.mdx) that can be accessed in the no-code builder. These components automatically create variables, allowing users to select dimensions or measures that can be used to filter datasets or drive other components.

Here we can see a simple bar chart that uses a multi-select measure variable to filter the data, currently showing orders by country:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/dim-meas-vars-table-before.png"]}/>

We've tied it to the variable from the picker in the Bar Chart inputs, like this:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/dim-meas-vars-inputs.png"]} width={400}/>

Which means if we choose a different measure, or in this case add two other measures, we're now showing orders, total products sold, and number of customers by country.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/dim-meas-vars-table-after.png"]}/>

Dimensions and measures as variables are powerful because they let users dynamically change the data being displayed in charts or tables without needing to write any code. This adds a significant level of interactivity to your dashboards without requiring additional code on your part.

<Callout emoji="üö®">
  It's important to make sure that you use a picker component that matches the type of value your chart is expecting. For example, the Bar Chart's "metric" input expects an array of measures, as it can support displaying multiple measures at once. This means you should use the **MultiSelectorMeasure** component to select measures for a Bar Chart, rather than the **SelectorMeasure** which only allows single selections (and may cause errors).
</Callout>

### Example: Connect a Pie Chart to a Metric Picker

In this video, we set up a single-measure picker, give it a default value, and connect it to a pie chart. We then show how it can switch between multiple measures.
