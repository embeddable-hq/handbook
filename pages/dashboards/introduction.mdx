# Introduction to Dashboards

Embeddable provides a **no-code builder** that lets non-technical users create, edit, and organize analytics dashboards without writing SQL or code. 

It brings together your **data models** (defined in code) and your **components** (written in React), giving end users an intuitive, drag-and-drop environment to configure visuals, filters, interactivity, and more.

## Why a No-Code Builder?

- **Empower Non-Tech Users**: Allow product managers, analysts, or support teams to build dashboards themselves.  
- **Faster Iterations**: Dashboards can be designed and tested on the fly. No need to wait for dev cycles to adjust charts or filters.  
- **Reuse & Scale**: Your code-defined models and components are made available in one place. Embeddable handles the plumbing - so a single chart component can be reused by multiple teams or use cases.

## High-Level Workflow

1. **Define Components & Models in Code**  
   - Your technical teams build [React components](/development/defining-components) (e.g. charts, controls) and [data models](/data-modeling/introduction), then [push them](/development/pushing-code) to Embeddable.  

2. **Build Dashboards with Drag & Drop**  
   - **Add** a component (like a line chart or dropdown) onto the canvas.  
   - **Customize** it using the [inputs](/development/defining-components#configure-in-embts) available - your team have full control over these.

4. **Preview & Interact**  
   - **Preview** the dashboard right there, with live data. 
   - Build in [interactivity](/dashboards/interactivity) to create dynamic, engaging experiences.   

5. **Test Security Contexts**  
   - Switch between different [security-contexts](/data-modeling/row-level-security#testing-security-contexts-in-embeddable) (e.g. “User A” or “User B”) and [environments](/data/environments), seeing the exact data and set up your users see. 

6. **Publish & Embed**  
   - Once satisfied, click [Publish](/dashboards/publishing). 
   - [Embed](/deployment/embedding) the resulting dashboard on your website or app using a web-component (not an iFrame).

With the **no-code builder**, everyone in your organization - devs and non-devs alike - can collaborate on analytics dashboards. Devs define the underlying data logic and React components; end users assemble, configure, and publish dashboards. 

## A Native Look and Feel

Embeddable dashboards appear on your site through a **web component** (`<em-beddable>`). This approach offers:

- **Seamless Integration**: The web component behaves like any native HTML element, so your dashboard feels right at home in your layout.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Automatic breakpoints and scaling help your dashboards adapt to smaller screens without extra effort.
- **Flexible Branding**: Any theming you’ve applied (e.g., custom colors) comes through naturally, since the canvas is invisible and won’t override your site’s look.

By design, visitors can’t tell they’re viewing something “external” - it looks and behaves like a **built-in** part of your website.
