# Developer Console

Embeddable provides a **developer console** that logs the key events and requests occurring inside your dashboard, making it easier to debug or optimize. In this console, you’ll see,

### 1. **Info**:
  - **`loadData` Request**: For each component, shows the parameters passed (dimensions, measures, timeDimensions, etc.).
  - **Generated SQL**: The actual query Embeddable forms behind the scenes.
  - **`loadData` Response**: For each component, the results returned.  
  - **Variable Changes**: Whenever a variable updates (e.g. from an event), you’ll see the old value and the new value.

### 2. **Warnings**:
  - Any caution messages about potential issues—like missing trailing slashes in base URLs or unsupported operators.
  - Tells you if loading is blocked by a pre-aggregation being built.

### 3. **Errors**:
  - Detailed logs of failures (e.g., invalid tokens, network errors, or filter misconfigurations).

The Console is also available when [developing locally](/development/local-environment).
