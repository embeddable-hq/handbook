# Bring your own Cube

Embeddable comes with a built-in Cube deployment. This lets you get started without any setup, and makes the platform simple to use out-of-the-box.  In some cases, however, you may want to connect your own [Cube deployment](https://cube.dev/docs/product/deployment) instead. This page explains how.

## When to use built-in vs. bring-your-own

Most users start with the **built-in Cube** managed by Embeddable. It works immediately, requires no setup, and keeps costs lower.

You might choose to **bring-your-own-Cube** if:

- You already have an existing [**Cube Cloud**](https://cube.dev/product/why-cube-cloud) or [**Cube Core**](https://cube.dev/product/cube-core) setup.
- You want to connect other tools, other than Embeddable, to your Cube deployment.
- You need advanced control over infrastructure.

If you are not sure, start with Embeddable’s managed Cube. You can always switch later.

## Built-in Cube deployment

By default, Embeddable runs on a managed Cube deployment.

Advantages:

- No setup required.
- Instantly available for use—no setup required before creating [dashboards](/dashboards/introduction).
- Lower cost—no separate cube license to pay.
- No infrastructure to manage.
- Backed by excellent support from the Embeddable team.

## Bring-your-own-Cube

You can also connect Embeddable to an external Cube deployment. Refer to the following sections based on your deployment type:

- [**Connecting Embeddable to Cube Cloud**](/data/cube-cloud)
- **Connecting Embeddable to Cube Core**

If you use this option, the **Connect your data** and **Data modelling** sections of this handbook are not relevant to you.
