# Generate Data Models

With our AI input below, you can effortlessly generate [Cube.js data models](/data-modeling/introduction) from your existing SQL queries / Database table definitions **right on this page**. This feature streamlines the process of creating data models, allowing you to get up and running quickly (you can always continue to refine them later).

Copy and paste the following SQL into the AI Model Generator to see how it processes a query with multiple dimensions and measures.

```SQL
SELECT
  c.country AS "c.country",
  c.signup_source AS "c.signup_source",
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) AS "no_of_customers",
  MIN(c.created_at) AS "first_signup_date",
  MAX(c.created_at) AS "last_signup_date"
FROM public.customers AS c
GROUP BY
  c.country,
  c.signup_source
ORDER BY
  count_customers DESC;
```
