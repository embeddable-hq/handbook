# Using Cube Cloud with dbt

If you already use [**dbt**](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/projects) for your data modelling, you donâ€™t need to start over when adopting [**Cube Cloud**](https://cube.dev/docs/product/getting-started#getting-started-with-cube-cloud). Cube Cloud integrates directly with [**dbt**](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/projects) projects, letting you reuse your existing models and build metrics, joins, and [pre-aggregations](/data-modeling/caching/pre-aggregations#what-are-pre-aggregations) on top of them. Finally, you can create [views](/data-modeling/views) to organize and present your data model, and expose it to Embeddable using the [Data Provider API](/data/cube-cloud#data-provider-api).

Refer to the diagram below to see how dbt and Cube Cloud work together. From data modelling in dbt to semantic enrichment in Cube.

## Before you start

This guide assumes that:

- You already have an **existing dbt project** and are familiar with running `dbt build` and `dbt run`.
- You have access to your dbt projectâ€™s **`manifest.json`** file, generated after `dbt build`/`dbt run` .
- You are using **Cube Cloud** for your Cube deployment.
- Youâ€™re comfortable using **Python** and managing dependencies with a `requirements.txt` file.

The example below shows how **dbt** and **Cube Cloud** work together. Youâ€™ll connect your dbt project, extend your models with Cubeâ€™s semantic capabilities, and eventually [build dashboards](/dashboards/building-dashboards) in Embeddable.

## 1. Set up a simple dbt model

Letâ€™s start with a minimal dbt model. In your dbt project, define a model called `customers`:

```sql
-- models/customers/customers.sql
{{ config(materialized='view') }}

SELECT
  id,
  email,
  country,
  signed_up_at,
  signed_up_at_with_time
FROM {{ source('public', 'customers') }}
```

Run `dbt build` in **dbt** to build your model, then use `dbt run` to materialize it in your database (as a view in this example).

Cube works with all dbt materializations except [ephemeral](http://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#ephemeral) models. You can learn more about dbt materializations [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations).
</Callout> 

Once the command completes, dbt generates a `manifest.json` file under **target** folder that describes your models, sources, and lineage. Cube uses this file to understand your dbt project structure.

## 2. Connect Cube Cloud to your dbt project

Now weâ€™ll connect Cube Cloud to your dbt project. For this step, youâ€™ll need the [`cube_dbt`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/reference/cube_dbt) package and the `manifest.json` generated by your dbt project.

### Add the `cube_dbt` package to your `requirements.txt` file

The [`cube_dbt`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/reference/cube_dbt) package helps define your semantic layer on top of existing dbt models extending your dbt work seamlessly within Cube.

Add it to your `requirements.txt` file located in the **root** of your Cube Cloud project:

```
cube_dbt
```

Once you add this to your `requirements.txt`, **Cube Cloud** automatically installs the package when it builds your branch.

### Add the `manifest.json` file to the root of your project

Commit your dbt `manifest.json` file to the **root folder** of your Cube project.  This enables Cube to read your dbt manifest and render dbt models directly inside your Cube model files.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/manifest-json-cube-folder-min.png"]}/>

### Render your dbt models in Cube

`cube_dbt` package provides convenient tools to render dbt models in YAML files using [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/).

To do this, dbt models must be made accessible from Jinja templates so they can be referenced in your Cube models. Weâ€™ll use the [`globals.py`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/configuration/recipes/environment-variables#globalspy-file) file for this.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
The [`globals.py`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/configuration/recipes/environment-variables#globalspy-file) file in **Cube Cloud** is a special configuration file that lets you define **Python variables, functions, and imports** that can be used across your entire Cube project. Itâ€™s particularly useful for creating **reusable logic** that can be accessed from any part of your data model.
</Callout> 

Here, we use it to expose dbt models through two helper functions: [`dbt_models`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/reference/cube_dbt#dbtmodels) and [`dbt_model`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/reference/cube_dbt#dbtmodel) in your `globals.py` file:

```python
# globals.py
from cube import TemplateContext
from cube_dbt import Dbt

dbt = Dbt.from_file('./manifest.json')
template = TemplateContext()

@template.function('dbt_models')
def dbt_models():
    return dbt.models

@template.function('dbt_model')
def dbt_model(name):
    return dbt.model(name)
```

---

### Things to notice

- **`dbt = Dbt.from_file('./manifest.json')`**
    
    This is the simplest way to read your `manifest.json` file from the local project directory.You can also load manifest file from **remote storage** (both public and private).
    Learn more ways to load your manifest file [here](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/recipes/dbt#loading-dbt-projects).
    
- **Template functions**
    
    The `dbt_models()` and `dbt_model(name)` functions expose your dbt models to Jinja templates, allowing you to render them dynamically inside Cube model files. 
    Learn more about ways to render dbt models in Cube [here](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/recipes/dbt#rendering-dbt-models).

## 3. Create a Cube model from a dbt model

Now, letâ€™s define a Cube model that builds on top of our `customers` dbt model.

```yaml
# model/cubes/customers.yaml
{% set model = dbt_model('customers') %}
cubes:
  - {{ model.as_cube() }}
 
    dimensions:
      {{ model.as_dimensions() }}
      
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: "Customer Count"
```

Things to notice:

- `{% set model = dbt_model('customers') %}` loads the `customers` model directly from your dbt project, making it available in your Cube models. It uses the `dbt_model` function we defined earlier in the `globals.py` file.
- [`{{ model.as_cube() }}`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/reference/cube_dbt#modelas_cube) and [`{{ model.as_dimensions() }}`](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/reference/cube_dbt#modelas_dimensions) automatically import the dbt modelâ€™s structure columns, data types, and relationships , so you donâ€™t need to redefine them manually. Learn more about model functions [here](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/reference/cube_dbt#model-class).
- You can then enhance the model with additional semantics like **measures**, **joins**, or **pre-aggregations** right within Cube.
- In the example above, weâ€™ve added a simple `count` measure showing how you can define measures directly at the Cube layer.

You can now query your `customers` data within your Cube environment, just like any other Cube model.

## Best practice

Itâ€™s best practice to render each dbt model (or data mart) as a **cube in its own file**. This keeps your Jinja templates simple and makes your data model easier to maintain as it grows.

For example, if your dbt project defines three models  `customers`, `products`, and `orders` youâ€™d create three separate Cube models:

```
model/cubes/
  customers.yaml
  products.yaml
  orders.yaml
```

You can easily customize **measures**, **joins**, and **pre-aggregations** that apply to each cube individually.

This approach keeps your models modular, readable, and consistent even when combining dbt and non-dbt cubes in the same project.

## 4. Connect your Cube instance to Embeddable

Once your models are available in Cube, use our [**Data Provider API**](/data/cube-cloud#data-provider-api) to connect your Cube instance to Embeddable.

All your models from Cube will automatically appear in Embeddable.

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/cube-dbt-project-in-embeddable-ezgif.com-resize-video.mp4"
    width="1920"
    height="1080"
/>

## 5. Scaling up: working with larger dbt projects

In most real-world dbt projects, youâ€™ll have multiple layers:

- **Staging models** for cleaning and standardizing raw data
- **Intermediate models** for transformations and joins
- **Marts** that serve as your final reporting layer

Typically, youâ€™ll expose your [**marts**](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts) in Cube, since theyâ€™re the cleanest, analytics-ready layer of your dbt project.

Your `globals.py` would now look like this filtering to include only models from your marts layer:

```python
# globals.py
from cube import TemplateContext
from cube_dbt import Dbt

dbt = Dbt.from_file('./manifest.json').filter(paths=['marts/'])
template = TemplateContext()

@template.function('dbt_models')
def dbt_models():
    return dbt.models

@template.function('dbt_model')
def dbt_model(name):
    return dbt.model(name)

```

This setup imports only dbt models located in the `marts/` directory into Cube. You can then define **joins** between marts, add **measures**, or create **pre-aggregations** to optimize performance and build **views** on top to create a clear facade for your data model.
