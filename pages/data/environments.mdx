# Set up Environments

**Environments** let you map **data models** to different sets of **database connections**, depending on the **user**.  This makes it easy to:

- Test embeddable against different **environments** (e.g. prod, QA, staging).
- Implement **single-tenancy** (database-level security) where each customer has their own database (or set of databases).

## How It Works

<Steps>

### **Define Connections**  
   Use the [Connections API](./connect-your-database) to create named database connections (e.g. `"prod-postgres"`, `"staging-postgres"`). Each connection includes the **credentials** (host, port, user, etc.) for a particular database.

### **Assign `data_source` in Your Models**  
   In your `.cube.yml` (or `.cube.js`) files, specify `data_source` for each model. If omitted, it defaults to `"default"`:
   ```yaml
   cubes:
     - name: orders
       sql_table: public.orders
       data_source: primary_db
   ```
   This tells Embeddable that the “orders” model should look for a connection named `"primary_db"` in the chosen environment.

### **Create an Environment**  
   Define an **environment** that maps each `data_source` to a corresponding **connection**:
   ```ts
   // for security reasons, this must *never* be called from your client-side
   fetch('https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/environments', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       name: 'prod',
       datasources: [
         { data_source: 'primary_db', connection: 'prod-postgres' },
         { data_source: 'warehouse', connection: 'prod-bigquery' }
       ]
     })
   });
   ```
   - **`name`** is a unique ID for the environment (e.g. `"prod"` or `"microsoft"`).  
   - **`datasources`** is a list mapping each model’s `data_source` to a named **connection** (e.g. in the above example, all models whose `data_source` is set to `"primary_db"` will use the connection named `"prod-postgres"`).
   - Learn more about `region` [here](/deployment/deployment-regions).

### **Use the Environment via Token API**  
   When requesting a [**security token**](/deployment/tokens-api), supply the `environment` field:
   ```ts
   {
     embeddableId: "<dashboard-id>",
     environment: "prod",
     // ...
   }
   ```
   - Embeddable automatically routes each model’s `data_source` to the connections defined in your `"prod"` environment.  
   - If `environment` is omitted, it uses the `"default"` environment (which is a special environment that always maps `data_source` names onto a `connection` of the same name).

</Steps>

### CRUD Operations

The `POST` request above represents a `CREATE` action, but all `CRUD` operations are available. 

- **POST** `/api/v1/environments`  
  Create a new environment.  
- **GET** `/api/v1/environments`  
  List all environments.  
- **PUT** `/api/v1/environments/{name}`  
  Update an existing environment.  
- **GET** `/api/v1/environments/{name}`  
  Retrieve a specific environment’s details.  
- **DELETE** `/api/v1/environments/{name}`  
  Delete the named environment.

## Testing in the No-Code Builder

To preview environments **before** publishing, you can create or update your `src/embeddable.com/presets/security-contexts.sc.yml` ([here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/embeddable-boilerplate/blob/main/src/embeddable.com/presets/security-contexts.sc.yml)) with entries specifying the `environment`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Example customer 1
     environment: production
     securityContext:
       country: United States

   - name: Example customer 2
     environment: staging
     securityContext:
       country: Germany
   ```

In the builder UI, you can then choose **“View as”** → “Example customer 2” to load the **staging** environment, verifying your data and filters. Switch back to **“Example customer 1”** to confirm **production** data.

**Advanced use-case**: If you have multiple data models each with unique `data_source` values, you can define an environment that includes only the data sources you want for a particular user—offering fine-grained control over which models (and thus which databases) are active for that environment.
