# Connect Your Database

You can connect one or more databases to Embeddable. We call these **Connections**. 

- **Read-only access:** Embeddable only reads from your database - it never writes to it.
- **Connection options:** Connect directly or via SSH.
- **IP whitelisting:** Restrict access to your database by allowing only Embeddableâ€™s fixed IPs ([learn more](/deployment/deployment-regions#ips-to-whitelist)).

## Connections API

Use our **Connections API** to connect Embeddable to your database(s).

The below is a `CREATE` action, but all `CRUD` operations are available, with sample scripts in [your repo](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/embeddable-boilerplate/tree/main/src/embeddable.com/scripts).

```javascript
const apiKey = '<your API Key>';
const connectionName = '<some unique name>';
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.us.embeddable.com'; // US API
// const BASE_URL = 'https://api.eu.embeddable.com'; // EU API

const resp = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/v1/connections`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` /* keep your API Key secure */,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        name: connectionName,
        type: 'postgres', // Database type
        credentials: {
            host: '...',
            database: '...',
            user: '...',
            password: '...',
            port: ..., // optional, number
            ssl: true, // optional, boolean
        },
    }),
});
```
- `apiKey`: This is located on the homepage of your workspace.
- `connectionName`: Unique name for the database connection within your workspace.
- `type`: Which driver to use (postgres, bigquery, etc). Find your database [here](./credentials).
- `credentials`: A javascript object containing the credentials expected by the driver:
    * The necessary credentials for each database are available [here](./credentials). 
    * Credentials are securely encrypted.
    * We strongly suggest creating a **read-only** database user for each connection.

## CRUD Operations

Refer to the specific scripts in [your repo](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/embeddable-boilerplate/tree/main/src/embeddable.com/scripts) to easily manage connections:
- **Create a connection:** `connection-create.cjs`
- **List connections:** `connection-list.cjs`
- **Read a specific connection:** `connection-read.cjs`
- **Update a connection:** `connection-update.cjs`
- **Delete a connection:** `connection-delete.cjs`

To run any script, use the following command:

```bash
node src/embeddable.com/scripts/<script>.cjs
```

Or use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Testing Your Connection

To confirm your connection works, use the `/test` endpoint, which is also available as a [script](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/embeddable-boilerplate/tree/main/src/embeddable.com/scripts) in your repo. 

```javascript
const apiKey = '<your API Key>';
const connectionName = '<some unique name>';
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.us.embeddable.com'; // US API
// const BASE_URL = 'https://api.eu.embeddable.com'; // EU API

fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/v1/connections/${connectionName}/test`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    },
});
```

## Using Your Connection

Reference your database connection by name in your [data models](/data-modeling/defining-models):

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    data_source: my-postgres-db # Points to the database connection
```

- Omitting the `data_source` field defaults to a demo connection named `default`.

## Multiple databases

Embeddable supports connecting to **multiple databases** out-of-the-box.  

To do so, simply: 
- create a separate **connection** for each database (see "Connections API" above)
- then point each of your **models** at the appropriate **connection** (see "Using your connection" above).

Sometimes, however, you'll want to point a model at different databases, e.g:
 - to run against prod vs qa vs test databases.
 - to connect to different databases depending on the customer.

In those cases you'll need use what we call **Environments**.  Learn more [here](./environments).

## IP Whitelisting

You can restrict database access by allowing only Embeddableâ€™s IPs ([learn more](/deployment/deployment-regions#ips-to-whitelist)).

## SSH Connections (Bastion Host)

  Please contact us for help with this.

Embeddable also supports connecting to your database via SSH connection. The process works as follows:

<Steps>

### Whitelist Embeddable's SSH-specific IP's:

Details [here](/deployment/deployment-regions#ips-to-whitelist).

### Add public key to bastion user

This will be used for establishing the SSH tunnel.

- **US :** 
```bash
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMMDhwuLvNxkgh7armnFQ94MjFyA5EnAAYol9uXcj0Xi jump-server-us@embeddable.com
```

- **EU :** 
```bash
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJFIqQgU/5Cdbe8sTPZ9S3Zy6iTyBRNP7cjZmD5LtlX0 jump-server-eu@embeddable.com
```

### You'll need the following information 
- Bastion user
- Bastion host
- Host and port of the database (must be accessible from Bastion host)
- Database credentials needed by Cube

</Steps>

Pleas note: tunnels are per database server; for 2 different database servers, 2 SSH tunnels must be created. SSH users can be reused if both databases are accessible from the same bastion.

## Connect to External Data Platforms

Embeddable works seamlessly with Cube Cloud, allowing you to use your existing Cube models alongside Embeddable.

Follow the setup instructions [here](/data/integrations/cube-cloud) to connect your Cube Cloud instance and start using your data.
