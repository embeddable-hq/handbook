# Vanilla Components v1 - Intro for Existing Users

Hi there, thanks for being an awesome Embeddable user! As you probably know, since youâ€™re reading this document, weâ€™ve released a major upgrade to our Vanilla Components repository. 

## TL;DR:

- You can now import vanilla components as an NPM dependencyÂ **instead**Â of keeping a fork of it and merging in changes (like you currently do).
    - This means you can benefit from the latest vanilla components changes by simply updating the package version (instead of having a worry about merge conflicts)

```json
"dependencies": {
    "vanilla-components": "^1.0.0"
    ...
```

- We have also introducedÂ **theming**Â so you can apply color, font and other styles toÂ **all**Â your vanilla components in just a few lines of code.
    - E.g. you can change all the colours and fonts in all your components with just a couple of lines of code:

```jsx
{
  charts: {
    colors: ["#c5fae2", "#7ef2be", "#2ce391", "#00cc70"],
  },
  font: {
    family: "Inter",
  },
}
```

- If you want to benefit from either of the above, there are someÂ **migration steps**Â you'll need to perform. Please read on for more info.

## Things to Know

These two features are being released together, and to use one youâ€™ll need to use the other. Also, while awesome, these features come with a couple of significant caveats that we want folks to be aware of. Here they are:

1. If you have made changes to your existing vanilla components, switching to V1 will involve some changes to your repo. **Fear not!** This guide is here to help you navigate them.
2. If you choose to use Vanilla Components as a package, you do lose the opportunity to customize their code. **Fear not!** This guide will help you assess that choice *and* explain how you can put together a best-of-both-worlds scenario.
3. This change marks the end of *major* development on Vanilla Components from our side. **Fear not!** Weâ€™re not even close to slowing down - weâ€™ve got big component plans underway and will announce more as they get further along.

One final thing we want to be very clear: <span className="highlight">**you do not have to make this upgrade**</span>. If youâ€™re happy with your current setup and are not worried about potentially missing out on a few upcoming charts â€¦ keep what you have! We will continue to put out small bug fixes as patch releases, but weâ€™ll do that for both the `v0` and `v1` versions of Vanilla Components. 

## What to Expect

- `v0` - continued bug fixes if/when any bugs are identified
- `v1` - Some small chart improvements, possibly a handful of new charts, continued bug fixes
- The Future - A core rewrite of all charts, many new charts, even better theming, more customization options

## Should We Switch to Packaged Components / Themes?

There are a handful of questions you need to answer! Hereâ€™s a handy choose your own adventure scenario that should help:

<Steps>
### Have you already made changes to the existing Vanilla Components?
**No**  - Go to #4

**Yes** - Go to #2

### Have you changed most/all of the components, or just a handful?
**Handful** - Go to #4

**Most/All** - Go to #3

### Are you absolutely dying to use themes and donâ€™t want to code them in yourself?
**Yes** - Go to #4

**No** - Go to #5

### <span className="green">Use Packaged Components</span>

You can find [full instructions for upgrading here](theme-upgrading).

### <span className="red">Stick With What You Have</span>
</Steps>

## What Should We Do If Weâ€™re Not Switching To v1?

TL/DR: **nothing! ðŸŽ‰**

If youâ€™ve already made significant changes to your components, or just donâ€™t need themes/packaging and donâ€™t want your engineers to have to deal with the upgrade, you can stay on our `v0` release. 

As mentioned above, we *will* be fixing bugs in both `v0` and `v1`. Just keep pulling from the `main` branch of the `vanilla-components` repo to get our incoming fixes and merge them into your codebase.
