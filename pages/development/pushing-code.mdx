# Pushing code to your workspace

To make your [data models](/data-modeling/defining-models) and [components](/development/defining-components) available in the dashboard builder, you need to push them to your Embeddable Workspace.

You can do this by running the [**push command**](/development/pushing-code#push-command), which, by default, pushes both data models and components. 

## Controlling what gets pushed

If you store your models and components in [separate repos](/data-modeling/getting-setup#2-storing-models-separately), you can push them independently. 

To push components, in your `embeddable.config` file, simply set:

```tsx
pushModels: false, // default: true
pushComponents: true, // default: true
```

To push models, set the opposite:

```tsx
pushModels: true, // default: true
pushComponents: false, // default: true
```

During a push:

- If **`pushModels`** is true, model files (including `security-context.sc.yml`) are pushed.
- If **`pushComponents`** is true, all other component files (including `client-contexts.cc.yml`, custom types, and editors) are pushed.

### Running embeddable:dev

When building locally using [`embeddable:dev`](/development/local-environment): 

- If **`pushModels`** is false, local development uses models from your online workspace.
- If **`pushComponents`** is false, it uses components from your online workspace.
- A rebuild only occurs when files in the relevant set change (for faster iteration).

### Code version pickers in the builder

Two version pickers appear in the top menu in the dashboard builder to choose the **models version** and **components version**. Publishing a dashboard uses whichever models and components versions are currently selected. A version is only live **once published**.

## Push command

Use the following commands:

```bash
npm run embeddable:login
```

```bash
npm run embeddable:build
```

```bash
npm run embeddable:push
```

If you have multiple workspaces, you will be prompted to select which workspace you want to push to.

## Pushing using your API Key

You can also push your models and components using your API key, which is especially useful for integrating into your **CI/CD pipeline**:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email>
```

Replace `<API Key>` with your [actual API key](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace#retrieve-your-api-key) and `<Email>` with your registered email address.

Optionally, you can add a `message`, like so:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email> --message <Message>
```

This will appear in the **code version** picker in the no-code builder.
