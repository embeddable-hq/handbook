# Pushing code to your workspace

After defining your data models and components, you need to push them to your Embeddable workspace to make them available in the dashboard builder.

### Push command

Use the following commands:

```bash
npm run embeddable:login
```

```bash
npm run embeddable:build
```

```bash
npm run embeddable:push
```

If you have multiple workspaces, you will be prompted to select which workspace you want to push to.

### Pushing using your API Key

You can also push your models and components using your API key, which is especially useful for integrating into your **CI/CD pipeline**:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email>
```

Replace `<API Key>` with your [actual API key](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace#retrieve-your-api-key) and `<Email>` with your registered email address.

Optionally, you can add a `message`, like so:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email> --message <Message>
```

This will appear in the **code version** dropdown in the no-code builder.
