# Theming

Embeddable lets you control the look and feel of your analytics without hacking at the CSS. Currently, we provide a **constants file** in the [Starter Components](/dashboards/starter-components) where you can tweak key styling properties such as:

- **Fonts** (family, size, weight)  
- **Chart Colors** (e.g., primary series, hover states)  
- **Date display formats** (e.g. `month: 'MMM yy'`).

Since you have access to the underlying code, you can also make any other styling changes you want directly within the components. 

## Upcoming: Multiple Theme Support

We’re soon introducing a more advanced theming system, allowing you to:

- Create Multiple Themes (e.g., “Dark Mode”, “Corporate Brand”, “Holiday Special”, "Customer A Colors").

- Granular Control over each element (beyond fonts and colors).

- Switch Themes Dynamically via [clientContext](/development/client-context), letting you pass in a theme name or user preference.

With this enhancement, you’ll be able to swap themes on the fly—perfect for supporting dark mode or user-specific branding without redeploying or rebuilding. Stay tuned!
