# Defining Components

You can create **custom React components** in Embeddable using any JS libraries you like. 

Key capabilities include:

- **Define Inputs**: Make re-usable components by defining inputs your team can customize in the builder.
- **Load Data**: Dynamically fetch data from your database via Embeddable's [`loadData`](/development/loading-data) function.
- **Pass Events**: Capture user actions (e.g. button clicks) and send them back to Embeddable for interactive features like filtering. 

## How It Works

<Steps>

### **Build Your React Component (`.tsx`)**  
  Write a **standard React component** - handling your UI, props, and business logic.  

  For example, this simple **text component** displays a title and body:

  ```tsx
  // src/components/TextComponent/index.tsx

  import React from 'react';

  type Props = {
    title: string;
    body: string;
  };

  export default ({ title, body }: Props) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <p>{body}</p>
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

  There's nothing Embeddable-specific about this code - it's just standard React. 

### **Configure in `.emb.ts`**  
  In a **companion `.emb.ts` file**, define **inputs** and other configuration, including how to [load data](/development/loading-data). This file tells Embeddable **how** to expose the component in the no-code builder so it can be configured by your team without code:

  ```tsx
  // src/components/TextComponent/TextComponent.emb.ts

  import { EmbeddedComponentMeta, defineComponent } from '@embeddable.com/react';
  import Component from './index';
  import { Inputs } from '@embeddable.com/react';

  export const meta = {
    name: 'TextComponent', // a unique identifier that must match the file name (i.e. TextComponent.emb.ts)
    label: 'Text component', // user-facing name in the builder
    inputs: [
      {
        name: 'title', // unique identifier for this input
        type: 'string',  // determines the UI control to render (i.e. a text field in this case)
        label: 'Title', // the label shown in the builder
      },
      {
        name: 'body', // unique identifier for this input
        type: 'string', // renders a second text field. 
        label: 'Body', // the label shown in the builder
      }
    ]
  } as const satisfies EmbeddedComponentMeta;

  //The function that tells the SDK to include this component in the no-code builder.
  export default defineComponent(Component, meta, {
    props: (inputs: Inputs<typeof meta>) => {
      return {
        // the inputs are passed through to the React component as props
        title: inputs.title,
        body: inputs.body
      };
    }
  });
  ```

Two things to notice:
1. `inputs` tells Embeddable which input fields to show in the UI when using this component.  In this case, two text input fields.
2. `props` is a function that takes those `inputs` and maps them onto the `props` that should be passed into the React component when rendering.

### **Push to Embeddable**  
  Run `npm run embeddable:dev` to test out your component, and when you’re happy with it, [**push**](/development/pushing-code) your component code to Embeddable. Your teammates can now **drag, drop, and configure** it in their dashboards - no extra coding required.

</Steps>

## Example: a simple data component

Below is a simple **KPI chart** component that loads data from your database:

```tsx
// src/components/KPIChart/index.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { DataResponse, Measure } from '@embeddable.com/core';
import Loading from '../util/Loading'
import Error from '../util/Error'

type Props = {
  title?: string;
  metric?: Measure; // { name, title }
  results: DataResponse; // { isLoading, error, data: [{ <name>: <value>, ... }]
};

export default ({ title, metric, results }: Props) => {

  const { isLoading, data, error } = results;

  if(isLoading) {
    return <Loading />
  }

  if(error) {
    return <Error msg={error}/>;
  }

  const value = results.data?.[0]?.[metric.name] ?? 'No data';

  return (
    <div>
      {title && <h1>{title}</h1>}
      <p>{value}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And its `.emb` file, defining the **inputs** and **configuration**:

```tsx
// src/components/KPIChart/KPIChart.emb.ts

import { EmbeddedComponentMeta, defineComponent, Inputs } from '@embeddable.com/react';
import { loadData } from '@embeddable.com/core';
import Component from './index';

export const meta = {
  name: 'KPIChart', // an identifier - must match KPIChart.emb.ts
  label: 'KPI Chart', // user-facing name in the builder 
  inputs: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Title text',
    },
    {
      name: 'ds',
      type: 'dataset', // shows a dropdown of available datasets. These are created directly in the Builder.
      label: 'Dataset',
    },
    {
      name: 'metric',
      type: 'measure', // shows a dropdown of measures (defined in your data models)
      label: 'KPI',
      array: false, // specifies that users can select a single measure 
      config: {
        dataset: 'ds', // restricts measure options to the selected dataset
      }
    },
  ]
} as const satisfies EmbeddedComponentMeta;

//The function that tells the SDK to include this component in the no-code builder.
export default defineComponent(Component, meta, {
  props: (inputs: Inputs<typeof meta>) => {
    return {
      ...inputs, // the inputs are passed through to the component as props
      results: loadData({ // fetches data from your database and passes it to your component
        from: inputs.ds,
        measures: [inputs.metric], 
      })
    };
  }
});
```

The `defineComponent` and `loadData` functions used above are two of the **most powerful** parts of the Embeddable SDK. You can learn more about them here: [defineComponent](./define-component-function) and [loadData](/development/loading-data).

## Adding Component Previews

Embeddable supports real-time previews for all components, **including any you create**. You will see these previews when you click the "Add Component" button in the dashboard builder.

<ImageGrid width='100%' images={["/img/component-previews.png"]}/>

To define your own components, you will need to **provide sample data** for the various inputs you've defined, especially any required inputs. To easily create sample data, you can use the mock data functions provided by the Embeddable core package.

```ts
// src/components/YourComponent/YourComponent.emb.ts
import { mockDataResponse, mockDimension, mockMeasure } from '@embeddable.com/core';
```

To create sample data, you can use the `mockDimension` and `mockMeasure` functions to create mock dimensions and measures, and the `mockDataResponse` function to create a mock data response. You can keep these definitions in the `.emb.ts` file or create a separate sample data file to keep things organized.

```ts
// src/utils/sampledata.ts
const dimensionName = 'country';
const dimensionGroupName = 'category';
const measureName = 'sales';

const sampleData = {
  dimension: mockDimension(dimensionName, 'string', { title: 'Country' });
  dimensionGroup: mockDimension(dimensionGroupName, 'string', { title: 'Category' }),
  measure: mockMeasure(measureName, 'number', { title: 'Sales' }),
  const results1Measure2Dimensions = mockDataResponse(
  [dimensionName, dimensionGroupName, measureName],
  [
    ['US', 'Cat 1', 120],
    ['US', 'Cat 2', 130],

    ['GER', 'Cat 1', 100],
    ['GER', 'Cat 2', 110],

    ['UK', 'Cat 1', 80],
    ['UK', 'Cat 2', 95],

    ['FRA', 'Cat 1', 70],
    ['FRA', 'Cat 2', 60],

    ['SPA', 'Cat 1', 55],
    ['SPA', 'Cat 2', 35],
  ],
);
};
```

To tell Embeddable you're creating a preview, you can use the `definePreview` function from the Embeddable React package:

```ts
// src/components/YourComponent/YourComponent.emb.ts
import { definePreview } from '@embeddable.com/react';
```

To define the preview, you can call the `definePreview` function, passing in your component and an object containing the sample data for each input. Note that required inputs must be provided with sample data for the preview to work correctly. Optional components can be left out if desired, though in some cases they may affect the component preview.

```ts
// src/components/YourComponent/YourComponent.emb.ts
export const preview = definePreview(Component, {
  xAxis: sampleData.dimension,
  segment: sampleData.dimensionGroup,
  metric: sampleData.measure,
  results: sampleData.results1Measure2Dimensions,
  title: '',
  showLabels: false,
  enableDownloadAsCSV: false,
  enableDownloadAsPNG: false,
});
```

Best practice is to put this code below the component meta definition, but above the `export default defineComponent(...)` line.

## Extending Vanilla Components

You can also **extend [existing components](/dashboards/starter-components)** like the Bar Chart or Pivot Table to add custom functionality. This allows you to leverage the existing UI while adding your own logic or data handling. There are two ways to do this:

### Copy the Component and Make It Your own

This is the way we recommend, as it will allow you to have both your customized component and the original Vanilla component available in the builder. There are two simple steps:

<Steps>
### Copy the Component Code

[Visit our repo](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/) and copy the component code from the Vanilla component you want to extend. For example, if you want to extend the Bar Chart, copy the code from `src/components/BarChart/index.tsx` and `src/components/BarChart/BarChart.emb.ts`.

### Create Your Own Component
Create a new folder in `src/components/` with your component name, and paste the copied code into it. Then, update the component name in the `.emb.ts` file to match your new component name. Make sure your component's `.emb.ts` file name matches the component name, e.g. if your component is named `MyBarChart`, the file should be `MyBarChart.emb.ts`.

</Steps>

From here, you'll have a fully functional component that you can customize further. You can add your own logic, inputs, and data handling as needed. When you're ready to test, just fire up the development server with `npm run embeddable:dev` and you'll be able to see your new component in the menu.

Some components are more complex than others, and a few of them call on various helper/utility files to handle specific functionality. If you find that your component is missing some of these dependencies, you can copy them over from the Vanilla component's folder as well. You can change the folder structure as needed, but make sure to update the import paths in your component code accordingly.

### Override the Vanilla Component Entirely

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> if you follow this route, you will no longer receive updates to the original component. They'll still come through when you update the package, but because this involves disabling a particular chart, you won't see them.</p>
</Callout>

If you want to completely override a Vanilla component, you can do so by disabling it in the `embeddable.config.ts` file. This will remove it from the builder and allow you to use your own version instead. The process for creating your own component is [the same as above](#copy-the-component-and-make-it-your-own) (you still need to copy the code), but you won't need to rename the component - you can use the same folder and component name as the original Vanilla component.

To disable the Vanilla component, open the `embeddable.config.ts` file in your project root and add the following code:

```ts
componentLibraries: [{
  name: '@embeddable.com/vanilla-components',
  exclude: ['BarChart'],
}],
```

... where `BarChart` is the name of the component you want to disable. You can add multiple components to the `exclude` array if needed. This will <strong>remove the Vanilla component from the builder</strong>, allowing you to use your own version instead.

Once you've done this, you can run `npm run embeddable:dev` to test your new component in the builder. It will now appear in the menu, and you can use it in your dashboard just like any other component. Keep in mind that until you make some changes, the component will look and behave exactly like the original Vanilla component, so you'll need to customize it further to make it your own.
