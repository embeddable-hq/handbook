# Developing Locally

You can spin up a **local workspace** for building and testing purposes. Simply run:

```bash
npm run embeddable:dev
```

- The local workspace uses the same [**data connections**](/data/connect-your-database) as your online workspace.
- Dashboards created locally **cannot be published**.
- Changes made locally **do not sync** to your online workspace - they remain local.

To push components or data models to your online workspace, [follow the instructions here](/development/pushing-code).
