# Introduction to development

Embeddable provides a set of standard, ready-to-use [charting components](/dashboards/starter-components) that reside **in your own repository**, making it easy to **customize**, **version**, and **integrate** them with your existing codebase.

You can also build fully **custom components**, just like you would from scratch. Behind the scenes, when you run our SDK's CLI to push your components to Embeddable:

- The CLI uses a standard JS bundler ([Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)) to bundle your components and generate a minified JS bundle.  
- This bundle, along with metadata from your [config files](/development/defining-components), is securely pushed to Embeddable.  

Since Embeddable uses standard bundling tools, you have **no limitations** on how you build your components—whether it’s the CSS framework, charting library, or design system you prefer. If it can be bundled, it can be sent to Embeddable.  

**If you can dream it, you can build it.** 🚀

Embeddable supports building components in React.js, but you can embed your dashboards anywhere - not just in React.
