# Switch the theme

**Switch between themes** inside the no-code builder:

1. Open the dashboard you created in [the previous step](/getting-started/first-embeddable), or create a new one.
2. In the top bar, toggle on **Preview** mode. 
3. In the **View as** dropdown, select **Dark Theme** under *Client Context*.

    width="1000"

/>

This interaction is powered by two things: 
 - **Theming**, which allows you to customise the look and feel of all your components.  Learn more [here](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/theming).
 - **Client context**, which allows you to apply behaviour to different clients (e.g. customize the look-and-feel or language for different end-users).  Learn more about Client Context [here](/development/client-context) or click [here](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/i18n) for Internationalisation (i18n).
