# Switch the theme

<Pill><span>Takes ~1 min</span></Pill>

**Switch between themes** inside the no-code builder:

1. Open the dashboard you created in [step 3](/getting-started/first-embeddable), or create a new one.
2. In the top bar, toggle on **Preview** mode. 
3. In the **View as** dropdown, select **Dark Theme** under *Client Context*.

This interaction is powered by two things:

### 1. **Client Context**
[Client context](/development/client-context) lets you pass dynamic values to your dashboards at runtime based on the user, such as:
- **client-specific theming** (e.g. color schemes)
-  **localization** (e.g. language)
- **dark/light mode**.

**For example**

```js
<em-beddable
  token="${json.token}"
  client-context="${JSON.stringify({ 
    colors: ['#555d8e','#566f94','#56819b'],
    font: 'Noto Serif',
    borderRadius: 10
  })}"
></em-beddable>
```

**Things to notice**
- You can pass in anything you like. 
- Client Context is made available to **both your components and your theme**, enabling you to customise dashboards dynamically for each user.
- You can define **Client Context presets** to switch between context objects in the builder (as shown in the video above). These live in the [presets folder](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/tree/main/src/embeddable.com/presets) of your repo.

### 2. **Theming**

The [theme](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/theming) is a structured **TypeScript object** that drives your dashboard’s appearance and behaviour. 

You can define as many themes as you like (e.g. light/dark mode or even a single theme per customer). One change to your theme updates the entire interface instantly.

**For example**

```ts
//embeddable.theme.ts

const themeProvider = (clientContext: any, parentTheme: Theme): Theme => {
    const myTheme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
        charts: {
            backgroundColors: clientContext.colors, //defined dynamically based on the client context
            borderColors: ['#555d8e','#566f94','#56819b'] //hard-coded in the theme
        },
    };
    const theme = defineTheme(parentTheme, myTheme) as Theme;
    return theme;
};
 
export default themeProvider;

```

**Things to notice**
- Your **client contexts** are automatically passed into [the theme](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/blob/main/embeddable.theme.ts) via the `themeProvider`.
- The `themeProvider` has one job: take the incoming **client context** and decide which values to apply to the **theme**.
- The theme shape used in the example comes from [Remarkable Pro](http://localhost:3000/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/theming), Embeddable's ready-to-use component suite.
