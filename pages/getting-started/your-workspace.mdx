# Workspace successfully set up! 🍾🎉

You have successfully: 
1. created your [Embeddable code repository](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace) and
2. [built and pushed your bundle](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace#push-the-code-bundle) to your workspace. 

Access your workspace here: [US](https://app.us.embeddable.com) | [EU](https://app.eu.embeddable.com).

## Next steps

You should now see two **[Example]** Embeddable dashboards and a **Create new embeddable** button, which means your workspace is now set up.

<ImageGrid images={["/img/starter-embeddables.png"]}/>

As you add models and components to your **Embeddable code repository**, you'll need to run the `embeddable:build` and `embeddable:push` steps again (described [here](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace#push-the-code-bundle)), to see them reflected in your workspace.

## Sample Embeddable dashboards

Have a look at the sample dashboards in your workspace. The default view is **builder mode** (see screenshot below) for building and editing your dashboards (we'll cover building dashboards on the [next page](/getting-started/first-embeddable)).

For now, click **"Preview"**, in the top bar, to switch to **preview mode**, where you can try interacting with the dashboard:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/click-preview.png"]}/>

You can use the **"View as"** dropdown to switch between different [themes](/getting-started/theme-components) (in this case, light and dark mode) and to view the dashboard from the perspective of different users (learn more about row-level security [here](/data-modeling/row-level-security)).

<ImageGrid images={["/img/view-as.png"]}/>

The second example dashboard uses [Custom Canvas](/dashboards/custom-canvas), which allows your users to build their own dashboards.  Again, click **Preview** to try it out:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/example-custom-canvas.png"]}/>

Next up, we'll explore **builder mode**.
