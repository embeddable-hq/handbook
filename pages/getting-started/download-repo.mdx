<Steps>

### Download our Boilerplate Repo

Download or clone our boilerplate repo [here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate
```

This includes:
 - the **full suite** of **Remarkable Pro components**, our production-ready component library. 
 - a set of **sample data models** for you to play with.

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd remarkable-pro-boilerplate

npm i
```

If you don't have `npm`, this means you need to install Node.js first ([here](https://nodejs.org/en/download))

### Set Your Region

In your [embeddable.config.ts](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/blob/main/embeddable.config.ts#L7-L15) file, depending on [your region](/deployment/deployment-regions), uncomment either:
```js
region: 'US',
```
or
```js
region: 'EU',
```

If you’re unsure which `region` you’re using, please reach out to us.
