<Steps>

### Download our Boilerplate Repo

Download or clone our boilerplate repo [here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/embeddable-boilerplate). This includes 3 simple sample components and models. You'll be deleting these and enabling our full suite of components later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/embeddable-hq/embeddable-boilerplate
```
### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```
### Set Your Region

In your `embeddable.config.ts` file, depending on [your region](/deployment/deployment-regions), uncomment either:
```js
region: 'US',
```
or
```js
region: 'EU',
```

If youâ€™re unsure which `region` youâ€™re using, please reach out to us. 

### Build the Code Bundle

Run the following command to build your code bundle:

```bash
npm run embeddable:build
```
</Steps>

On Windows, you may encounter an like `Cannot find module './swc.win32-x64-msvc.node'` at this point.

Make sure you have Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist

Following this, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`. Finally, install your `node_modules` again:

```bash
npm i
```
