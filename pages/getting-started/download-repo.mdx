git clone https://github.com/embeddable-hq/onboarding
```
### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```
### Set Your Location

Update your repo according to your region ([details here](/deployment/deployment-regions#update-your-configuration)).

If youâ€™re unsure which `region` youâ€™re using, please reach out to us. 

### Build the Code Bundle

Run the following command to build your code bundle:

```bash
npm run embeddable:build
```
