# Set up your Repo

The [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate) is the starting point for this guide. It includes:

- the full suite of [Remarkable Pro](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/introduction) components, our production-ready component library.
- a set of sample [data models](/data-modeling/introduction) for you to play with.

<Steps>

### Download our Boilerplate Repo

Clone our boilerplate repo to your machine using the git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate
```
or download the repo [here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate).

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned directory using your Terminal and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd remarkable-pro-boilerplate
```

```bash
npm i
```

If you don't have `npm`, this means you need to install Node.js first ([here](https://nodejs.org/en/download))

### Set Your Region

In your [embeddable.config.ts](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/blob/main/embeddable.config.ts#L7-L15) file, depending on [your region](/deployment/deployment-regions), set either:

```js
region: 'US',
```

or

```js
region: 'EU',
```

If you’re unsure which `region` you’re using, [learn more here](/deployment/deployment-regions) or reach out to us.
