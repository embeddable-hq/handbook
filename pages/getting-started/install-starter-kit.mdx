# Import Starter components

Now that you have a good idea of [how Embeddable components work](/development/defining-components), you're all set to build whatever components you want. That said, you can also make use of our **existing library of charts and controls** instead of having to reinvent the wheel. 

This **starter library** comes as a single NPM package (it's already in the `package.json` `dependencies` in the boilerplate repo you downloaded earlier) and has full support for everything Embeddable does, including [using themes](./theme-components).

Here's what you need to do to get set up:

<Steps>

### Uncomment the starter kit

Open `embeddable.config.ts` and **uncomment** the `componentLibraries` line:
```js
componentLibraries: ['@embeddable.com/vanilla-components'],
```

### Optionally delete the Example components

You probably don't need a "Hello World" component, and our starter kit includes a more robust Pie chart and Text Input. So go ahead and delete the entire `example` directory in the `src/embeddable.com/components` directory.


### Re-build or re-run the dev server

If you were running [the dev server](/development/local-environment), stop it and re-run it. If you were building the code, run `embeddable:build` and `embeddable:push` again (see [Building and Pushing](https://docs.embeddable.com/development/pushing-code#push-command) if you need a refresher).
</Steps>

That's it! You now have access to a full suite of components, including charts, tables, and controls. You can see these by clicking "Add Component" in your Embeddable Dashboard.

You're now fully prepared to start building dashboards with Embeddable.
