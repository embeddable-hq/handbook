# Set up our full Starter Kit

Now that you've finished the homework and have a good idea of how Embeddable components work, you're all set to build whatever components you want. That said, you can also make use of our existing library of charts and controls instead of having to reinvent the wheel. This starter library comes as a single NPM package (it's already in the boilerplate you downloaded earlier) and has full support for everything Embeddable does, including [using themes](/development/theming).

Here's what you need to do to get set up:

<Steps>
### Delete the Example components

You probably don't need a "Hello World" component, and our starter kit includes a more robust Pie chart and Text Input. So go ahead and delete the entire `example` directory in the `src/embeddable.com/components` directory.

### Uncomment the starter kit

Open `embeddable.config.ts` and uncomment the `componentLibraries` line (typically [line 17](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/embeddable-boilerplate/blob/eaa160b10f0199febcb70f0c251a94e303782b55/embeddable.config.ts#L17) if you haven't changed anything else). You will also need to delete the following line:

```typescript
  componentLibraries: [
    { name: '@embeddable.com/vanilla-components', include: [] },
  ],
```

If you're looking to only use _some_ of the starter kit, please see the comments in that file for more details. We recommend you use the entire library for now, but you can always remove components later. In either case, when you're done editing, save that file.

### Re-build or re-run the dev server

If you were running [the dev server](/development/local-environment), stop it and re-run it. If you were building the code, run `embeddable:build` and `embeddable:push` again (see [Building and Pushing](https://docs.embeddable.com/development/pushing-code#push-command) if you need a refresher).
</Steps>

That's it! You now have access to a full suite of components, including charts, tables, and controls. You can see these by clicking "Add Component" in your Embeddable Dashboard. You're now fully prepared to move forward with Embeddable.
