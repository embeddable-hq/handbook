# Set up your Workspace

<Steps>

### Push the Code Bundle

Open a Terminal in the local directory of your [boilerplate repository](/getting-started/download-repo) and run the following command to login to your workspace (make sure the region was set correctly in the [previous step](/getting-started/download-repo#set-your-region)):

```bash
npm run embeddable:login
```

Next, bundle the boilerplate repository, by running:

```sh
npm run embeddable:build
```

Then run the following to push the code bundle to your workspace:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push
```

This uploads your **data models** and **components** to your team workspace so you can use them in the Embeddable platform to build a dashboard.

To learn more about the push command and its options, see [Push Command](/development/pushing-code#push-command).

### Refresh Your Workspace

After the push succeeds:

- Go back to your workspace page ([US](https://app.us.embeddable.com) or [EU](https://app.eu.embeddable.com)).
- Refresh the page.
- You should see two **[Example]** Embeddable dashboards and a **Create new embeddable** button, which means your workspace is now set up.

If you make changes to the code in your [boilerplate repository](/getting-started/download-repo), you'll need to run the `embeddable:build` and `embeddable:push` steps above again, to see them reflected in your workspace.

### Sample Embeddable dashboards

Have a look at the sample dashboards in your workspace. The default view is **builder mode** (see screenshot below) for building and editing your dashboards (we'll cover building dashboards on the [next page](/getting-started/first-embeddable)). 

For now, click **"Preview"**, in the top bar, to switch to **preview mode**, where you can try interacting with the dashboard:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/click-preview.png"]}/>

You can use the **"View as"** dropdown to switch between different [themes](/getting-started/theme-components) (in this case, light and dark mode) and to view the dashboard from the perspective of different users (learn more about row-level security [here](/data-modeling/row-level-security)).

<ImageGrid images={["/img/view-as.png"]}/>

The second example dashboard uses [Custom Canvas](/dashboards/custom-canvas), which allows your users to build their own dashboards.

Next up, we'll explore **builder mode**.
