# Set up your workspace

The [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate) is the starting point for this guide. It includes:

- the full suite of [Remarkable Pro](/component-libraries/remarkable-pro/introduction) components, our production-ready component library.
- a set of sample [data models](/data-modeling/introduction) for you to play with.

<Steps>

### Download our Boilerplate Repo

Clone our boilerplate repo to your machine using the git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate
```
or download the repo [here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate).

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned directory using your Terminal and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd remarkable-pro-boilerplate
```

```bash
npm i
```

If you don't have `npm`, this means you need to install `node` first ([here](https://nodejs.org/en/download))

### Set Your Region

Open the [embeddable.config.ts](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/blob/main/embeddable.config.ts#L7-L15) file in your code editor. Depending on [your region](/deployment/deployment-regions), set either:

```js
region: 'US',
```

or

```js
region: 'EU',
```

If you're unsure which `region` you're using, [learn more here](/deployment/deployment-regions) or reach out to us.

### Push the Code Bundle

Run the following command to login to your workspace:

```bash
npm run embeddable:login
```

Next, bundle the boilerplate repository, by running:

```sh
npm run embeddable:build
```

Then run the following to push the code bundle to your workspace:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push
```

This uploads your [data models](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/tree/main/src/embeddable.com/models/cubes) and [components](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/blob/main/embeddable.config.ts#L20) to your team workspace so you can use them in the Embeddable platform to build a dashboard.

To learn more about the push command and its options, see [Push Command](/development/pushing-code#push-command).
