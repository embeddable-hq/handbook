# Set up your Workspace

Let’s get your workspace configured in just a few steps.

<Steps>

### Log in to Embeddable

Depending on which region your deployment is in, login to the appropriate workspace:

   - US: [https://app.us.embeddable.com](https://app.us.embeddable.com)
   - EU: [https://app.eu.embeddable.com](https://app.eu.embeddable.com)

### Retrieve Your API Key

On your workspace homepage, look for your **API Key**. You’ll need this shortly to push code from your local machine to your workspace.

### Push the Code Bundle

Open a terminal in the directory of your [Starter Repo](/getting-started/download-repo) and run:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email>
```
e.g:
```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key abc --email my@email.com --message "My first components"
```

Note: if you're using Powershell, you may need to put the `--` in double quotes, like so:
```bash
npm run embeddable:push "--" --api-key abc --email my@email.com --message "My first components"
```

This uploads your **data models** and **components** so you can use them in the Embeddable platform.

### Refresh Your Workspace

After the push succeeds:
- Go back to your workspace page.
- Refresh the page.
- You should see a **Create new Embeddable** button, which means your workspace is now set up.
