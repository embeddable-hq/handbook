<Steps>

### Log in to Embeddable

Remember to open your region:

   - US: [https://app.us.embeddable.com](https://app.us.embeddable.com)
   - EU: [https://app.eu.embeddable.com](https://app.eu.embeddable.com)

### Retrieve your API Key

This is located on the homepage of your workspace. 

### Push the code bundle to your workspace

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the [Starter Repo](/getting-started/download-repo) and run:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email>
```

### Refresh the page

The components and data models in the Starter Repo are now available in your workspace to build dashboards with, and you should now see a **"Create new Embeddable"** button.
