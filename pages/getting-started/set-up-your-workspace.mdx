# Set up your Workspace

<Steps>

### Log in to Embeddable

Depending on which region your deployment is in, login to the appropriate workspace:

   - US: [https://app.us.embeddable.com](https://app.us.embeddable.com)
   - EU: [https://app.eu.embeddable.com](https://app.eu.embeddable.com)

### Retrieve Your API Key

On your workspace homepage, look for your **API Key**. You’ll need this shortly to push code from your local machine to your workspace.

### Push the Code Bundle

Open a terminal in the directory of your [Boilerplate Repo](/getting-started/download-repo) and run the following to login to your workspace (make sure the region was set correctly in the [previous step](/getting-started/download-repo#set-your-region)):

```bash
npm run embeddable:login
```

Next, bundle the boilerplate repository, by running:

```sh
npm run embeddable:build
```

Then run the following to push the code bundle to your workspace:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push
```

This uploads your **data models** and **components** to your team workspace so you can use them in the Embeddable platform to build a dashboard.

To learn more about the push command and it's options, see [Push Command](/development/pushing-code#push-command).

### Refresh Your Workspace

After the push succeeds:
- Go back to your workspace page.
- Refresh the page.
- You should see a **Create new Embeddable** button, which means your workspace is now set up.
