# Set up your Workspace

<Pill>Takes ~5 mins</Pill>

<Steps>

### Log in to Embeddable

Depending on which region your deployment is in, login to the appropriate **workspace**:

   - US: [https://app.us.embeddable.com](https://app.us.embeddable.com)
   - EU: [https://app.eu.embeddable.com](https://app.eu.embeddable.com)

### Retrieve Your API Key

On your workspace homepage, look for your **API Key**. You’ll need this shortly to push code from your local machine to your workspace.

### Push the Code Bundle

Open a terminal in the directory of your [Boilerplate Repo](/getting-started/download-repo) and run:

```bash
npm run embeddable:login
```
Then:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push
```

If you want to include a message (or pass your API key and email explicitly), you can run:

```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email> --message <Message>
```
For example:
```bash
npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key c26624b --email my@email.com --message "My first components and models"
```

Note: if you're using Powershell, you may need to put the `--` in double quotes, like so:
```bash
npm run embeddable:push "--" --api-key c26624b --email my@email.com --message "My first components and models"
```

This uploads your **data models** and **components** to your team **workspace** so you can use them in the Embeddable platform to build a dashboard. 

### Refresh Your Workspace

After the push succeeds:
- Go back to your workspace page.
- Refresh the page.
- You should see a **Create new Embeddable** button, which means your workspace is now set up.
