# Build your first Embeddable

Create and embed your first Embeddable dashboard.

<Callout emoji="💡">
  An **Embeddable** is an interactive dashboard that you embed in your web
  application.
</Callout>

This guide assumes you have already [set up your workspace](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace) and [explored your workspace](/getting-started/your-workspace).

<Steps>

### Create a New Embeddable

On your workspace homepage, click **Create new Embeddable** to create a fresh dashboard.

### Add a Dataset

Datasets are how you access data on a dashboard.

Your workspace is linked to our sample database and uses the sample [data models](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/tree/main/src/embeddable.com/models/cubes) that you pushed to your workspace from your boilerplate repository.

<VideoComponent
  src="/video/add-a-dataset.mp4"
  width="934"
  height="720"
/>

1. In the **Datasets Panel** in the bottom right, click the **+** icon.
2. Name your dataset "**data**" (or give it any other name).
3. Select **Daily Listeners Data** (or any other sample data model), then **Save**.

### Add a Donut Chart

Build your dashboard by adding components to the canvas.

<VideoComponent src="/video/add-pie.mp4" width="934" height="720" />

1. Click **Add component**. Pick **Donut Chart**.
2. In the edit panel, set **Dataset** to the dataset you just created.
3. Select the **Measure** "# Total listens (Daily Listeners Data)" and the **Dimension** "Country (Daily Listeners Data)".
4. Hit **Add to dashboard**.

<Callout emoji="⚡️">
  **Bonus**: check the **console** in the right sidebar to see what's happening
  behind the scenes.
</Callout>

### Add Interactivity

Interactivity allows user interaction with one component to affect the data shown in another component. E.g. choosing a value from a dropdown can, for example, affect the data loaded in the charts in the rest of the dashboard.

Adding interactivity is quick and easy.

<VideoComponent
  src="/video/add-interactivity.mp4"
  width="934"
  height="720"
/>

1. Click **Add component**, choose **Date-Range Picker - Presets**, then hit **Add to dashboard** to add it to your canvas.

<Callout emoji="⚡️">
  In the right-hand Variables panel in the Builder, you’ll see a new variable
  appear: **date-range value**. Variables store outputs from interactive
  components (like date pickers) and can be passed around the dashboard.
</Callout>

Let's now link that variable to our Donut Chart (as shown in video above, and described below).

2. Edit your **Donut Chart**, by selecting it and then clicking the pencil icon.
3. Click **Filter** (under the Dataset input) and, from the dropdown, choose the **Date listened (Daily Listeners Data)** Dimension.
4. Next to the filter operator (“In date range”), click the **link** icon, select the **date-range value** variable, then hit **Save**.

</Steps>

<Callout emoji="🥳">
  **Success!** Switch to Preview mode in the top bar to test the interaction.
</Callout>

### Embed your dashboard

As a final step, test embedding your dashboard in a simple HTML page. Steps described below.

<VideoComponent
  src="/video/publish-version.mp4"
  width="934"
  height="720"
/>

<Steps>

### Save a version

1. Click **'Save version'** at the top of your dashboard.
2. Enter a simple **description** and click **'Save new version'**.

### Publish the dashboard

3. Click the **'Publish'** button.
4. Select the **'Production'** environment (the green box).
5. Click **'Publish'** to publish your saved version.
6. Grab your API Key and Embeddable ID from the **'View instructions'** section at the bottom of the modal.

### Test embedding

7. Head to your code repo, open `src/embeddable.com/scripts/preview-in-html.cjs`.
8. Update the `BASE_URL`, `API_KEY`, and `EMBEDDABLE_ID` ([here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate/blob/main/src/embeddable.com/scripts/preview-in-html.cjs#L5-L9)) with the values from your dashboard. Then run:

   ```bash
   node src/embeddable.com/scripts/preview-in-html.cjs
   ```

9. Go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see your embedded dashboard in action! 🤩

<Callout emoji="🥳">
  **Notice:** If you "View page source" you can see that Embeddable doesn't use iframes. It uses a
  [web-component](/deployment/embedding) that embeds directly as part of your DOM.
</Callout>

```html

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Embedabble</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <script
      type="module"
      src="https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/js/v1/"
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <em-beddable token="..."></em-beddable>
  </body>
</html>
```

Congratulations! You've built your first Embeddable - now you're well on your way to creating amazing, interactive analytics experiences.
