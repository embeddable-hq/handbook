# Troubleshooting Database Connections

Having trouble connecting Embeddable to your database? Below are common issues and fixes.

1. **Incorrect Credentials**
    - Double-check your **username**, **password**, and **database name**.  
    - Make sure the **host** and **port** match your database configuration.
    - Sometimes, if your database password contains special characters such as backslashes (`\`), you may need to escape them properly. For instance, a password like `J\c\X` should be written as `J\\c\\X`.

2. **Firewall or Network Restrictions** 
    - Ensure your database server allows incoming connections from Embeddable’s [IP addresses](/getting-started/connect-your-database/connections-api#ip-whitelisting).  
    - If you’re hosting on-prem or behind a VPN, confirm that Embeddable can reach the server.

3. **SSL or TLS Requirements**  
   - Some databases require SSL. Confirm that you’ve enabled `ssl: true` (or relevant SSL parameters) [in your credentials](/getting-started/connect-your-database/connections-api#connections-api) if needed.  
   - Check your certificates and ensure the SSL configuration matches your DB server’s setup.

4. **Version Mismatch**  
   - Make sure your database version is supported by [Cube](https://cube.dev/docs). 
   - Older versions of certain databases may have quirks or missing features that affect connecting to Embeddable.

5. **Missing Tables or Schemas**  
   - If a query returns “table not found,” confirm that `sql_table` or `sql` references the correct schema/table names.  
   - Check that the **user** you've used when connecting has the right **permissions** to access those tables.

6. **Data Source Configuration**  
   - In your model file (`<name>.cube.yml`), verify the `data_source` field references the correct connection in your settings (omitting the `data_source` field defaults to a demo connection named `default`).
   - If you have multiple connections, confirm you’re using the right one.

7. **Security Context Settings**  
   - If row-level security is blocking access, ensure your **securityContext** is correct.  
   - Review any `WHERE` clauses referencing `COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext` to confirm values are passed properly.

8. **Connection URL Format**  
   - For databases like Redshift, Snowflake, or MS SQL, small typos in the URL or host can cause “connection refused” errors.  
   - Compare your connection string against sample configurations in our docs.
