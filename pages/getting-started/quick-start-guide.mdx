## Prerequisites

This guide also assumes you have at least a basic understanding of JavaScript and how to use the (command-line) Terminal.

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- A code-editor suitable for JavaScript such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 20 or higher (run `node -v` to check)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/) (run `git -v` to check).

## Steps

Embeddable stores your **charting components**, **data models** and **themes** in code, so you have full control over the **look-and-feel** and the **data**.  Start with step 1 below.
