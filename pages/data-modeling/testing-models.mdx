# Testing using the Data Playground

You can test your models in Embeddable’s **Data Playground**, available both in your **online workspace** and **locally** by running:

```bash
npm run embeddable:dev
```

- Simply click the Data Playground tab in the left sidebar. 
- You’ll then be able to test each element of your models, view the generated SQL, and inspect the results. 

<VideoComponent
    src="/video/data-playground.mp4"
    width="1250"
    height="854"
/>

## Testing using Cube's Data Playground

You can also use Cube's local Data Playground to test and debug your models.

  This relies on you having [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your local machine.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create a `.env` file:  
   Ensure your `.env` file is in the same directory as `cube-playground.yml` ([this directory](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components/tree/main/src)).

### Populate the `.env` file: 

   Populate the `.env` file with the correct database credentials for your database as per the [Cube's documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/product/configuration/data-sources).

    ```env
    CUBEJS_DB_TYPE=postgres
    CUBEJS_DB_HOST=localhost
    CUBEJS_DB_NAME=your_database
    CUBEJS_DB_USER=your_username
    CUBEJS_DB_PASS=your_password
    ```

    You may need to add:
    ```env
    CUBEJS_DB_SSL=true
    ````

    You can also add set the **desired level of logging detail**, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring:
    ```env
    CUBEJS_DB_SSL=warn 
    ```
    **Possible values**:  
    `warn` *(default value)*: Logs warnings in addition to errors.  
    Example: Deprecation warnings or configuration issues. 

    `error`: Logs only critical errors that affect the application's functionality.  
    Example: Database connection issues or critical service failures.

    `info`: Logs general informational messages about the application's operations.  
    Example: Application startup, health checks, or key lifecycle events. 

    `trace`: Logs the most detailed information, primarily used for in-depth debugging.  
    Example: Internal function calls and exhaustive execution details.


### Run the Playground  
   Execute the following command to start Cube's data playground:
   ```bash
   npm run cube:playground
   ```

   You can also use docker compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f ./src/cube-playground.yml up
   ```

### Access the Playground 
   Open your browser and navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to use Cube Playground.
