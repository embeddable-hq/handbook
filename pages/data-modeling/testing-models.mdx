# Testing your data models

You can test your data models:
- in a local Embeddable workspace. 
- locally using Cube's data playground. 

In early 2025, we'll be launching an in-platform model playground, eliminating the need to set up Cube locally.

## Testing locally using a local Embeddable workspace 

To try out your models in Embeddable's no-code dashboard builder, you can spin up a local workspace by running:

```bash
npm run embeddable:dev
```

## Testing locally with Cube's Data Playground

  This requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create a `.env` file:  
   Ensure your `.env` file is in the same directory as `cube-playground.yml`.

### Populate the `.env` file: 
   Populate the `.env` file with the correct database [credentials for your database](http://localhost:3000/getting-started/connect-your-database/credentials) as per the [Cube.js Environment Configuration](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/configuration/environment-variables).
    ```env
    CUBEJS_DB_TYPE=postgres
    CUBEJS_DB_HOST=localhost
    CUBEJS_DB_NAME=your_database
    CUBEJS_DB_USER=your_username
    CUBEJS_DB_PASS=your_password
    ```

    You may need to add:
    ```env
    CUBEJS_DB_SSL=true
    ````

    You can also add set the **desired level of logging detail**, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring:
    ```env
    CUBEJS_DB_SSL=warn 
    ```
    **Possible values**:  
    `warn` *(default value)*: Logs warnings in addition to errors.  
    Example: Deprecation warnings or configuration issues. 

    `error`: Logs only critical errors that affect the application's functionality.  
    Example: Database connection issues or critical service failures.

    `info`: Logs general informational messages about the application's operations.  
    Example: Application startup, health checks, or key lifecycle events. 

    `trace`: Logs the most detailed information, primarily used for in-depth debugging.  
    Example: Internal function calls and exhaustive execution details.


### Run the Playground  
   Execute the following command to start Cube's data playground:
   ```bash
   npm run cube:playground
   ```

   You can also use docker compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f ./src/cube-playground.yml up
   ```

### Access the Playground 
   Open your browser and navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to use Cube Playground.

## Upcoming: In-Platform Model Playground

We're excited to announce that an **in-platform model playground** will be available soon. This feature will allow you to test and debug your data models directly within Embeddable's interface, streamlining your workflow and removing the need for local setups.
