# Row-level security

For **customer-facing analytics**, each **end-user** should only see the **data they’re allowed to see** and nothing more. That’s why row-level security is a **first-class citizen** in Embeddable.

## Security Tokens and Security Context

Embeddable dashboards are [embedded](/deployment/embedding) in your site via an HTML web component:

```html
<em-beddable 
  token="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."
/>
```

- The `token` parameter (a **security token**) must be retrieved **server-side** from our [Tokens API](/deployment/tokens-api) each time a user accesses your Embeddable dashboard.

- When requesting this security token, you also send a **security context**. This is simply a **JSON object** containing *any fields* you need to pass to your data models:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/security-token
securityContext: { 
    userId: 45, 
    orgId: "9sZSJ9LHsiYXR0cmlidXRlIjoiZ2VvaXBf",
    countries: ['us-east', 'eu-west']
}

Response:
{ "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI..." }
```

### How to use the Security Context

The security context is automatically available inside your data models, and is accessed like so:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    title: "Orders"
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM public.orders
      WHERE org_id = '{ COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.orgId }'
      AND user_id = { COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.userId }
```

Or, if your customer data is split by schema:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    title: "Orders"
    sql_table: "{ COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.orgId }.orders"
```

## Using Jinja for Dynamic SQL

Jinja ([docs](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/)) is used under the hood to compile SQL. The `{ ... }` notation in your model files is replaced **before** sending the query to your database. For example:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    title: "My customers"
    sql: >
      SELECT * 
      FROM public.customers 
      WHERE orgId = '{ COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.ordId }'
```

compiles to:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM public.customers
WHERE ordId = 'abc123'
```

### Conditional SQL

The nice thing about Jinja is that it also allows conditional logic for more advanced scenarios:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    title: "My customers"
    sql: >
      SELECT * 
      FROM public.customers
      {% if COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.superUser %}
        WHERE 1 = 1
      {% else %}
        WHERE organisationId = '{ COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.organisationId }'
      {% endif %}
```

For users flagged as `superUser`, the compiled SQL becomes:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM public.customers
WHERE 1 = 1
```

### Multiple Values

When your security context contains an array (e.g. a list of allowed countries), use the `list` helper:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    title: "My customers"
    sql: >
      SELECT *
      FROM public.customers
      WHERE country IN {{ list(COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.countries) }}
```

If `countries` is `["United States", "Canada", "Mexico"]`, the resulting SQL looks like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM public.customers
WHERE country IN ('United States', 'Canada', 'Mexico')
```

## Testing Security Contexts in Embeddable

To try out different security contexts in the no-code builder, define them in your repo at `src/presets/security-contexts.sc.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Nike
  securityContext:
    orgId: org5
    userId: 23478

- name: Adidas
  securityContext:
    orgId: 23
    userId: cmlidXRlIjoiZ2VvaXBf9sZSJ9LHsiYXR0
```

Each entry appears under the **“View as”** dropdown in the builder:

<ImageGrid images={["/img/security-context-preset.png"]}/>

Switch between contexts to preview your dashboard as different users.
