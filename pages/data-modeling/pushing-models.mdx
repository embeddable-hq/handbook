# Pushing Data Models to Your Workspace

If you are defining your models in code (as opposed to using the [Data Model Editor](/data-modeling/getting-setup#defining-models-in-the-data-model-editor)), you need to push your models to your Embeddable workspace to make them available in the dashboard builder.

Follow the [Pushing Models and Components](/development/pushing-code) instructions to push your models.

## Safe Publishing

Once you push your changes, your published customer-facing dashboards remain unaffected until you specifically click the **Publish** button. This allows you to view and test your changes in the builder experience before making them live for your customers.
