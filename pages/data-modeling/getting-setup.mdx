# Getting Set Up for Data Modeling

You can define your data models in individual files using **YAML** or **JavaScript**. Generally, YAML is recommended for its simplicity and readability. (See [Cubeâ€™s documentation](https://cube.dev/docs) if you prefer JavaScript-based models.)

Embeddable supports two options for storing your models:
1. **In the same repository** as your [charting components](/getting-started/download-starter-repo).
2. **In a separate repository** on its own.

## 1. Storing Models with Your Components

If you prefer an all-in-one approach, you can keep both your models and charting components in a single repository. This is ideal if a single team manages everything or you want an easy, consolidated project structure.

For a reference setup, take a look at our [starter repo](/getting-started/download-starter-repo). It demonstrates a typical way to organize your files. 

This is the default and requires no extra set up.

## 2. Storing Models Separately

For teams that handle data modeling independently or need tighter control over versioning, storing models in a separate repository can be beneficial. By splitting models away from the charting components:

- You can version and push each set of files independently.
- Data teams can work on model updates without interfering with UI components, and vice versa.

You can see an example of a [dedicated models repo here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/only-models/tree/main).

Importantly, you'll need to update `embeddable.config.ts` to include:
```tsx
pushModels: true,
pushComponents: false
```
- This ensures that, when you [push your models](/development/pushing-code) to your Embeddable workspace, only relevant model files are sent. 

- Importantly, this also includes any [security context presets](/data-modeling/row-level-security#testing-security-contexts-in-embeddable) you've created to test row-level security.
