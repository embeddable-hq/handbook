# Defining Data Models

You can define your models using YAML or JavaScript. In most cases, YAML is recommended for its simplicity and readability, and that's what we focus on in this guide. 

### File Format
- Embeddable recognizes any file ending in `.cube.yml` or `.cube.js`.
- Each model file begins with the `cubes:` keyword.

Here's a simple example:

```yaml
# src/models/customers.cube.yml

cubes:
  - name: customers # A unique identifier
    title: My customers # A display-friendly title
    data_source: default  # The data source connection to use
    sql: >  # Defines the underlying query
      select *
      from public.customers

    dimensions: # 'dimensions' define fields for filtering or grouping data
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: email
        title: 'Email address'
        sql: email
        type: string

      - name: country
        title: 'Country of origin'
        sql: country
        type: string

      - name: signed_up_at
        sql: signed_up_at
        type: time

      - name: full_name
        title: "Full name"
        sql: CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
        type: string

    measures: # 'measures' define aggregated values (e.g. counts, sums)
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: "# of Customers"

    joins: # 'joins' define relationships between this model and others
      - name: orders # the name of the data model to join to (not the table)
        sql: '{CUBE}.id = {orders}.customer_id'
        relationship: one_to_many

```

  YAML is sensitive to indentation. Use an online YAML validator like [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/) to check your formatting.

## Core Parameters

- `name`: A unique identifier for the model (no spaces or special characters). `name` is used internally by Embeddable and Cube to reference the model. Updating it once it's in use can potentially break your dashboards.  

- `title`: An optional, human-readable name that appears in the UI. You can change it anytime without impacting the underlying logic.

- `data_source`: Specifies which data source the model belongs to. This should match the connection name you defined when [connecting your database](/data/connect-your-database).

- `sql_table`: Points to the actual table or view in your database (e.g., `public.customers`). Use this for straightforward mappings.

- `sql`: An alternative to `sql_table` if you need to define a custom query rather than referencing a single table/view. For example:
  ```yaml
  sql: >
    SELECT
      id,
      name,
      created_at
    FROM public.customers
    WHERE status = 'active'
  ```

<Callout emoji="💡">
   A common misconception is that you have to write **GROUP BY** statements in your `sql`. Instead, use `sql` to define a base table and then separately define [dimensions and measures](/data-modeling/dimensions-and-measures). The data modeling layer automatically generates the necessary SQL, including GROUP BY clauses, behind the scenes.
</Callout>

- `dimensions`: There are all the "virtual columns" that you want to expose in your model (learn more [here](./dimensions-and-measures)).

- `measures`: These are all the "metrics" that you want to be able to calculate from your model (learn more [here](./dimensions-and-measures)).

## Other Parameters

You can also define other parameters, including [joins](./joins) between models and [pre-aggregations](./caching/pre-aggregations) to optimize performance.

- `joins`: Defines how to [link models](/data-modeling/joins) and handle join relationships.

- `description`: A short note or summary of what the model represents or how it should be used. Useful for keeping track of intentions or business context.

- `pre_aggregations`: Optional configurations for creating and managing materialized views or rollups. This helps improve performance by caching common aggregations [learn more](/data-modeling/caching/pre-aggregations). 

These parameters allow you to tailor each data model to match your analytics needs, whether you’re simply mapping a table or performing advanced transformations and aggregations.
