# Defining Data Models

You can define data models using either yaml or javascript. Generally, yaml is recommended due to its simplicity and readability. On this page, we focus exclusively on yaml (see [Cube’s documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/overview) for more information on using JavaScript-based models)

In Embeddable, each data model is defined in its own `.cube.yml` file, and begins with the `cubes:` keyword. 

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Embeddable **only** picks up on model files that end in `.cube.yml` or `.cube.js`.

```yaml
# src/models/customers.cube.yml

cubes:
  - name: customers
    title: My customers
    data_source: default
    sql: >
      select *
      from public.customers

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: email
        title: 'Email address'
        sql: email
        type: string

      - name: country
        title: 'Country of origin'
        sql: country
        type: string

      - name: signed_up_at
        sql: signed_up_at
        type: time

      - name: full_name
        title: "Full name"
        sql: CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
        type: string

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: "# of Customers"

    joins:
      - name: orders # the name of the data model to join to (not the table)
        sql: '{CUBE}.id = {orders}.customer_id'
        relationship: one_to_many

```

  YAML is sensitive to indentation. Use an online YAML validator like [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/) to check your formatting.

## Core Parameters

- `name`: A unique identifier for the model (no spaces or special characters). `name` is used internally by Embeddable and Cube to reference the model. Updating it once it's in use can potentially break your dashboards.  

- `title`: An optional, human-readable name that appears in the UI. You can change it anytime without impacting the underlying logic.

- `data_source`: Specifies which data source the model belongs to. This should match the connection name you defined when [connecting your database](/data/connect-your-database).

- `sql_table`: Points to the actual table or view in your database (e.g., `public.customers`). Use this for straightforward mappings.

- `sql`: An alternative to `sql_table` if you need to define a custom query rather than referencing a single table/view. For example:
  ```yaml
  sql: >
    SELECT
      id,
      name,
      created_at
    FROM public.customers
    WHERE status = 'active'
  ```
  A common misconception is that you have to write **GROUP BY** statements in your `sql`. Instead, use `sql` to define a base table and then separately define [dimensions and measures](/data-modeling/dimensions-and-measures). The semantic layer automatically generates the necessary SQL, including GROUP BY clauses, behind the scenes.

- `dimensions`: There are all the "virtual columns" that you want to expose in your model (learn more [here](./dimensions-and-measures)).

- `measures`: These are all the "metrics" that you want to be able to calculate from your model (learn more [here](./dimensions-and-measures)).

## Other Parameters

You can also define other parameters, including [joins](./joins) between models and [pre-aggregations](./caching/pre-aggregations) to optimize performance.

- `joins`: Defines how to [link models](/data-modeling/joins) and handle join relationships.

- `description`: A short note or summary of what the model represents or how it should be used. Useful for keeping track of intentions or business context.

- `pre_aggregations`: Optional configurations for creating and managing materialized views or rollups. This helps improve performance by caching common aggregations [learn more](/data-modeling/caching/pre-aggregations). 

These parameters allow you to tailor each data model to match your analytics needs, whether you’re simply mapping a table or performing advanced transformations and aggregations.
