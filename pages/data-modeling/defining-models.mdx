# Defining models

Each data model is defined in its own `.cube.yml` file, and begins with the `cubes:` keyword:

```yaml
# src/models/customers.cube.yml

cubes:
  - name: customers
    title: My customers
    data_source: default
    sql_table: public.customers

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: email
        title: 'Email address'
        sql: email
        type: string

      - name: country
        title: 'Country of origin'
        sql: country
        type: string

      - name: signed_up_at
        sql: signed_up_at
        type: time

      - name: full_name
        title: "Full name"
        sql: CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
        type: string


    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: "# of Customers"

    joins:
      - name: orders # the name of the data model to join to (not the table)
        sql: '{CUBE}.id = {orders}.customer_id'
        relationship: one_to_many

```

## Core Parameters

- `name`: A unique identifier for the model (no spaces or special characters). This name is used internally by Embeddable and Cube to reference the model.

- `title`: An optional, human-readable name that appears in the UI. You can change it anytime without impacting the underlying logic.

- `datasource`: Specifies which data source the model belongs to. This should match the connection name you defined when [connecting your database](/getting-started/connect-your-database).

- `sql_table`: Points to the actual table or view in your database (e.g., `public.customers`). Use this for straightforward mappings.

- `sql`: An alternative to `sql_table` if you need to define a custom query rather than referencing a single table/view. For example:
  ```yaml
  sql: >
    SELECT
      id,
      name,
      created_at
    FROM public.customers
    WHERE status = 'active'
  ```

## Additional Parameters

Within each file, you can also define other parameters, including **joins** between models and **pre-aggregations** to optimize performance.

- `joins`: Defines how this model connects to other models (cubes). For example:
  ```yaml
  joins:
    - name: orders
      sql: '{CUBE}.id = {orders}.customer_id'
      relationship: one_to_many
  ```
  This tells Cube how to link data sets and handle join relationships.

- `description`: A short note or summary of what the model represents or how it should be used. Useful for keeping track of intentions or business context.

- `meta`: Store additional info for a **measure** or **dimension**. For example, use `meta` to pass a `$` symbol for a currency column or any other custom data that you want to be available in your Embeddable components.
  ```yaml
    measures:
        - name: price
          type: sum
          sql: price_usd
          meta: null
          pretext: $
  ```

  Embeddable's Starter Components support `pretext` out of the box.

- `preAggregations`: Optional configurations for creating and managing materialized views or rollups. This helps improve performance by caching common aggregations. For instance:
  ```yaml
  preAggregations:
    mainRollup:
      type: rollup
      measureReferences:
        - count
      dimensionReferences:
        - country
      timeDimensionReference: signed_up_date
      granularity: day
  ```

These parameters allow you to tailor each data model to match your analytics needs, whether you’re simply mapping a table or performing advanced transformations and aggregations.
