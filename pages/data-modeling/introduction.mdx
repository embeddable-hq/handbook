# Introduction

Embeddable uses a **semantic layer** to define and manage your data.

## What is a Semantic Layer?

A semantic layer is an abstraction layer that sits between raw data in databases and your analytics, defining data in clear, consistent terms that users understand.

It's especially beneficial for customer-facing analytics because it ensures: 

- **Consistency**: Unified metrics and definitions across all dashboards.
- **Maintainability**: Centralized business logic, avoiding code duplication.
- **Performance**: Query optimization and reduced load on databases.

  Under the hood, Embeddable uses [Cube](https://cube.dev/) as its semantic layer. This means you can define, manage, and transform data in a standard format (access Cube's docs [here](https://cube.dev/docs/product/introduction)).

## Data Models

Data models are the building blocks that power the semantic layer. 

If you think of the semantic layer as the high-level framework for defining and interpreting data across your organization, data models spell out the actual **fields**, **relationships**, and **aggregations**.

### A Basic Example

Suppose you have a `customers` table:

id | email                | signed_up_at | country
---|----------------------|--------------|----------
1  | strahar0@...        | 2023-09-04   | United States
2  | smcpeake1@...       | 2021-09-06   | Iceland
3  | jeffrey_b@...       | 2021-09-06   | Canada

To model this in Embeddable you might create a file like so inside your repo:


```yaml
# src/models/customers.cube.yml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    title: "My Customers"
    sql_table: public.customers
    # sql: >
    #   select *
    #   from public.customers

    dimensions:
      - name: country
        title: "Country of origin"
        sql: country
        type: string

      - name: signed_up_date
        title: "Signed up date"
        sql: signed_up_at
        type: time

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: "# of Customers"
        
```
- `name`: A unique identifier (no spaces or special characters).
- `title` (optional): A friendly name that appears in the UI.
- `sql_table`: Points to the actual table or view in your database. 
- `sql`: Rather than pointing to a table / view, you can write SQL. Any SQL you write should match your own database's dialect. 
- `dimensions`: Fields to filter or group by (think columns or derived fields).
- `measures`: Aggregations (count, sum, avg, etc.).

### Using your models

Once you've defined your data models, push them to your Embeddable workspace to make them available in the dashboard builder. 

When you add a charting component (e.g. a pie chart or a dropdown) to a dashboard, youâ€™ll be prompted to choose which dimensions and measures to use to populate the data. Behind the scenes, Embeddable automatically generates and sends the necessary SQL queries to your database.  

## Getting started

Here are some practical tips to help you design clear and manageable data models, especially when starting with a large database.

- **Start Small**: Identify just one or two key tables or entities from your database that support your main analytics use cases, and create simple models for those.

- **Add Complexity Gradually**: Once you have the basics working, expand your models with additional tables or fields as new insights are needed.

- **Keep Models Focused**: Keep each model mapped to a clear, logical part of your database to avoid confusion and make maintenance easier.

- **Use Clear Naming**: Give each model and field descriptive names that reflect its purpose. This helps everyone on your team understand the data at a glance.

- **Document as You Go**: Briefly note what each model represents and how itâ€™s used, so new team members or future you can jump in without guesswork.
