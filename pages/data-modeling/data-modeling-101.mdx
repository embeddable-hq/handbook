# Data modeling 101

Embeddable uses a **data modeling layer** to define and manage access to your data.

This page aims to provide you with the **fundamentals** you need to know to be successful with **data modeling** in Embeddable.

## What is a data modeling layer?

A **data modeling layer** is an abstraction layer that sits between the **raw data** in your databases and your analytics, defining data in clear, consistent terms that users understand. It is effectively a **single source of truth** for your data and metrics.

Using a data modeling layer (as opposed to writing each and every query, by hand, in SQL) comes with a number of significant  advantages, particularly for **customer-facing analytics**:

1. **Consistency.** No more worrying about whether all SQL queries on your dashboards are using the same consistent definition for a particular metric - you can be confident that the same definition is being used everywhere.
2. **Maintainability**. If the definitions of your metrics change, or your data changes (which it will…), you only need to update your models in one single place (not dig through and update dozens, if not hundreds of hand-written SQL queries).
3. **Speed**. You, or your non-technical teammates, can slice and dice and filter your data within Embeddable in just a few clicks, without having to write a single line of SQL, and you can be confident that the generated SQL will be optimized to perform well on your particular database.

## How is it used within Embeddable?

In Embeddable the **data modeling layer** is essential for **loading data** from your databases into your charts.  It is responsible for **generating the SQL** that will run against your database:

<ImageGrid width='85%' images={["/img/data_modeling_101.png"]}/>

<Steps>

### Team member configures chart

Firstly, in order for a user to see a chart in your embedded Embeddable dashboard, it has to be added to a dashboard in Embeddable’s no-code dashboard builder. E.g. a Pie Chart may be configured, as shown below, to show **# of orders**, purchased in the **Last 7 days**, sliced by **Location:**

<ImageGrid width='75%' images={["/img/config_pie.png"]}/>

### An end-user views the chart in their browser 

This Pie Chart will now show up on the embedded dashboard for the end-user, but before it can render, it first it needs to load its data:

<ImageGrid width='75%' images={["/img/loading_pie.png"]}/>

So, what the chart will do (while showing a loading spinner like above) is use the configuration provided in Step 1 (above) to **request** data from the Embeddable servers. Such a **request** may look something like this:

```json
{
    "query": {
        "dimensions": [
            "orders.location"
        ],
        "measures": [
            "orders.count"
        ],
        "timeDimensions": [
            {
                "dimension": "orders.created_at",
                "dateRange": "Last 7 days"
            }
        ],
        "limit": 100
    }
}
```

### Data modeling layer converts the request to SQL

This is where the **data modeling layer** comes in.  The data modeling layer will take that **request** and convert it into the correct **SQL** for your database (and how exactly it does this we’ll explain below). 

The **generated SQL** may look something like this:

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(city, ', ', country) "orders__location",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.orders AS "orders"
WHERE
  (
    "orders".created_at >= '2025-02-25T00:00:00.000Z'::timestamptz
    AND "orders".created_at <= '2025-03-03T23:59:59.999Z'::timestamptz
  )
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC
LIMIT
  100
```

### SQL is run against your database

This SQL is then run against your database, the results are returned to the Pie Chart, and the Pie Chart can render itself in all its glory.

The returned results might look something like this:

```json
{
    "result":
    [
        {
            "orders.location": "Los Angeles, United States",
            "orders.count": "686"
        },
        {
            "orders.location": "Hamburg, Germany",
            "orders.count": "294"
        },
        {
            "orders.location": "Christchurch, New Zealand",
            "orders.count": "196"
        }
    ],
    "durationMs": 190
}
```

And the final rendered Pie Chart might then look like this:

<ImageGrid width='75%' images={["/img/rendered_pie.png"]}/>

</Steps>

## How does it generate SQL?

But how does the **data modeling layer** know what **SQL** to generate given a particular **request**?

Going back to our original flow diagram you can see that a **data modeling layer** is simply a box that takes a **request** as input and spits out **SQL**:

<ImageGrid width='85%' images={["/img/data_modeling_101.png"]}/>

In practice there is a little more to it.  A **data modeling layer** also has three other important inputs it uses when deciding what **SQL** to generate:

<ImageGrid width='100%' images={["/img/data_modeling_102.png"]}/>

1. **Database type**: in Embeddable this is defined by the type of the [database connection](/data/connect-your-database) you set up and it tells the data modeling layer whether to, for example, generate SQL in the Postgres, MySQL or Snowflake dialect (many other dialects supported).  This is important to the data modeling layer as different databases have slightly different syntax for different query constructs (as a simple example, Postgres surrounds table names with “double quotes”, whereas MySQL uses \`backticks\`).
2. **Security context**: this is just a simple set of key-value pairs (e.g. `{ "user_id": 1534 }`) that you pass to Embeddable when [generating a security token](/deployment/tokens-api) to load a dashboard in your application. It provides the necessary information for **row-level security** to be applied.  E.g. the `user_id` in this example may be used by the data modeling layer to apply a `WHERE user_id = 1534` filter to the generated SQL, ensuring that the end user **only** ever sees the data rows that they are allowed to see (learn more about how row-level security works in Embeddable [here](/data-modeling/row-level-security)).
3. **Data models**: this is where the magic happens.  Data models are simple files, defined by you, that give the data modeling layer all the context it needs to know in order to generate the correct SQL for your data.  The remainder of this page will take you through a simple example data model.

## Data models

**Data models** are the building blocks that power the **data modeling layer**.

Under the hood, Embeddable uses a popular data modeling language called [Cube](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/overview). We use it because it is very simple to learn, but is also very powerful and flexible. 

Let’s look at an example.

### A simple example

Suppose we have an `orders` table in our database like so:

| id | product | city | country | created_at | price_usd |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Eggs | Los Angeles | United States | 2025-03-01 | 3.79 |
| 2 | Milk | Christchurch | New Zealand | 2026-08-27 | 4.60 |

We could define a data model for it, in an `orders.cube.yml` file like so:

```yml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: public.orders

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
        public: false

      - name: product_name
        title: 'Product'
        sql: product
        type: string

      - name: location
        sql: CONCAT(city, ', ', country)
        type: string
        
      - name: created_at
        title: "Purchase time"
        sql: created_at
        type: time

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: '# of orders'

      - name: total_price
        title: "Total USD"
        type: sum
        sql: price_in_cents / 100.0
```

It may seem complicated at first, but there’s just a few simple concepts to understand and then you know everything you need to know.

**Things to notice:**

- The `name` of the cube is just a unique name we want to give to our **model** (doesn’t need to match the name of the table).
- The `sql_table` tells our data modeling layer (Cube) which table to use in the `FROM` clause when generating the SQL, e.g. `SELECT ... FROM public.orders ...`.
- The `dimensions` are just the **virtual columns** that we want to expose to the Embeddable dashboard builder
    - e.g. the **product_name** `dimension` has its `sql` parameter defined as `product` which simply means that if the **product_name** is requested by a chart, then that `sql` will be used in the generated SQL, e.g. `SELECT product FROM public.orders` .
    - whereas the **location** `dimension` has its `sql` defined as `CONCAT(city, ‘, ‘, country)` .  This means exactly the same.  If **location** is requested, then that `sql` will be used in the generated SQL, e.g. `SELECT CONCAT(city, ', ', country) from public.orders)` .
    - You can also expect to see these dimensions appear in the `GROUP BY` and `WHERE` clauses of the generated SQL, e.g. `GROUP BY CONCAT(city, ', ', country)` or `WHERE product = 'Ice cream'`
- The `measures` are the metrics we want to be able to calculate (`count`, `sum`, `count_distinct`, `max`, `min` etc.).   You can expect to see these in the `SELECT` and `HAVING` clauses of the generated SQL. E.g. `SELECT sum(price_in_cents / 100.0)`

Let’s go back to our Pie Chart configuration screen from earlier.  The reason `Product`, `Location` and `Purchase time` are even available inside Embeddable to choose from is because you’ve defined them in the data model:

<ImageGrid width='75%' images={["/img/pie_config_open.png"]}/>

Once you’ve defined your first data model, you just need to [push it to your Embeddable workspace](/data-modeling/pushing-models).  As soon as you’ve done that you will now automatically be able to [build dashboards and charts](/dashboards/building-dashboards) using any combination of your defined **dimensions** ( `Product`, `Location`, `Purchase time` ) and **measures** (`# of orders` and `Total USD`).

Notice that the **request** that is sent to our servers, that we looked at earlier, is just a combination of the `name` of the cube (`orders`) and the `name`s of the `dimensions` and `measures` from your model (`location`, `count` and `created_at`):

```json
{
    "query": {
        "dimensions": [
            "orders.location"
        ],
        "measures": [
            "orders.count"
        ],
        "timeDimensions": [
            {
                "dimension": "orders.created_at",
                "dateRange": "Last 7 days"
            }
        ],
        "limit": 100
    }
}
```

And finally notice that the generated SQL is simply taking the `sql` from the relevant sections of your data model file in order to serve the above **request**:

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(city, ', ', country) "orders__location",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.orders AS "orders"
WHERE
  (
    "orders".created_at >= '2025-02-25T00:00:00.000Z'::timestamptz
    AND "orders".created_at <= '2025-03-03T23:59:59.999Z'::timestamptz
  )
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC
LIMIT
  100
```

And that’s it.  You now understand how to create basic model files and how those model files tell our **data modeling layer** ([Cube](https://cube.dev/docs/product/data-modeling/overview)) how to generate the correct **SQL** for your database.

## **Summary (and additional notes)**

- You define **models** in `*.cube.yml` files.
    - **Note**: the `.cube.yml` extension is important.  Embeddable will only pay attention to data models ending in `.cube.yml` or `.cube.js`.
- Cube’s SQL generation **doesn't** contain complicated witchcraft 🧙. It will always try to generate the simplest SQL it can, given your **models**, the **database type** (snowflake, postgres, etc.), the **security context** and the particular data **request**.
    - Cube is also very good at [joins](/data-modeling/joins) (including multiple connected tables) and it will only perform them **if and when needed** to answer a data request.
- Any **filters** in a data request will automatically be applied as `WHERE` and / or `HAVING` clauses (Embeddable does not do any additional client-side filtering or post processing)
- The row `LIMIT` on every data request is set to 100 by default to protect your database but you can increase it to 10,000 (and can use paging if necessary).
- You can test out your models in Embeddable’s [**data playground**](/data-modeling/testing-models).

## Next steps:

- define some models ([learn more](/data-modeling/defining-models)) 🚀.
- test out your models in our [data playground](/data-modeling/testing-models).
- once you’re happy with them, [push the models](/development/pushing-code) to your workspace
- you can then use them to [build your dashboards](/dashboards/building-dashboards).
- you can also learn more about:
    - joins ([here](/data-modeling/joins))
    - row-level security ([here](/data-modeling/row-level-security))
    - caching ([here](/data-modeling/caching/in-memory))
