# Joins

When your database tables relate to each other, you can represent those relationships directly in your data models. This allows you to build dashboards using data from multiple tables without writing manual JOIN statements.

Imagine the following database:

| **Table**    | **Key Relationships**                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **customers** | A **customer** can have many **orders**. |
| **orders**    | Each **order** is linked to one **customer** and one **product**. |
| **products**  | Each **product** can appear in many **orders**. |

With these relationships, you can answer questions like:
- "How many **orders** did a specific **customer** place last month?"
- "What’s the most popular **product** in a specific **country** this week?"
- "Which **customer** has spent the most money?"

There are two ways to approach combining these tables:

### 1. One Model for Multiple Tables

You can use the `sql` parameter to combine tables. This approach is often very useful if multiple raw database tables need to be joined together to represent one ***clean*** **user-facing concept**.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers_and_orders_and_products
    sql: > 
      SELECT *
      FROM public.customers
      JOIN public.orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
      JOIN public.products ON products.id = orders.product_id
    ...
``` 
### 2. Multiple Models with Joins

The general rule of thumb is to try and have **one data model** for **each user-facing concept**. 

E.g. **Spotify** would probably want a data model to represent each of the following concepts: `playlists`, `listeners`, `artists`, `tracks`, etc.

Since `customers`, `orders`, and `products` are **user-facing concepts**, the best approach is therefore to create separate models and then link them, like so:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    sql_table: public.customers

    joins:
      - name: orders # the name of the model you're joining to
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {orders}.customer_id" # references the customer_id *column* in the orders model, but you can also reference dimensions (learn more below)
        relationship: one_to_many

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
    ...
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: public.orders

    joins:
      - name: products # the name of the model you're joining to
        sql: "{CUBE}.product_id = {products}.id" # references the id column in the products model, but you can also reference dimensions (learn more below)
        relationship: many_to_one
      - name: customers # the name of the model you're joining to
        sql: "{CUBE}.customer_id = {customers}.id" # references the id column in the customers model, but you can also reference dimensions (learn more below)
        relationship: many_to_one

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
    ...
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: products
    sql_table: public.products

    joins:
      - name: orders
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {orders}.product_id" # references the product_id column in the orders model, but you can also reference dimensions (learn more below)
        relationship: one_to_many

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
    ...
```

- **`name`**: In a `joins` block, `name` refers to another **model** (cube), not the underlying database table.

- **`sql`**: Specifies the SQL condition that defines how two models are related. You can reference either columns or dimensions:
  - `{products}.some_column` points to the **some_column** field in the **database table** associated with the **products** model.  
  - `{products.some_dimension}` refers to the **some_dimension** **dimension** that’s defined inside the **products** model.  
  - `my_products.some_column` accesses the **some_column** in the actual **my_products** table in your database (i.e. the raw table name).

- **`relationship`**:  Set `relationship` to [one_to_one](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/joins#one-to-one), [one_to_many](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/joins#one-to-many), or [many_to_one](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/joins#many-to-one) depending on your schema.

- **`primary_key`**: Each model should have a dimension marked `primary_key: true`. This ensures Cube can generate valid JOIN queries. By default, primary keys are hidden in the UI - use `public: true` if you want to expose them as dimensions. If no single column uniquely identifies rows, build a composite key with a custom SQL expression:
  ```yaml
  dimensions:
    - name: id
      sql: CONCAT_WS('|', tableA.id, tableB.id)
      type: string
      primary_key: true
  ```

## Joining data from multiple data sources

You can also join data stored in different data sources. Visit [Cube's documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/guides/recipes/query-acceleration/joining-multiple-data-sources) to learn more.
