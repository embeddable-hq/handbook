# Dimensions and Measures

**Dimensions** and **Measures** define how your data is segmented and summarized. For example:

    ```yaml
    dimensions:
      - name: country
        title: 'Country of origin'
        sql: country
        type: string 

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: "# of Customers"
    ```

With a single `country` dimension and a `count` measure, the following queries can be generated:

- **Total customers** (count of all rows).
- **Customers by country** (grouped by the `country` column).
- **Filtered counts** (e.g. customers in a specific country).

## Dimensions

**Dimensions** are the fields you want to **filter** or **group by**.

- Dimensions must come from **columns in the base table** you define using `sql_table` or `sql`.

- You can define a dimension for every column if you want all columns exposed, but you don't need to.

```yaml
  dimensions:
    - name: email
      title: "Email Address"
      sql: email
      type: string

    - name: country
      title: "Country"
      sql: country
      type: string

    - name: created_at
      title: "Created at"
      sql: created_at
      type: time
```
### Basic Structure

Each dimension has:
- `name`: A unique identifier (no spaces or special characters).
- `title` (optional): A user-friendly name for display in the UI.
- `sql`: The column or SQL expression from your base table/query.
- `type`: The data type (`string`, `number`, `time`, `geo`).
- `primary_key` (optional): Set this to `true` if it uniquely identifies rows.

### Examples

- **Combining first and last names**  
  Instead of defining separate dimensions for `first_name` and `last_name`, create a `full_name` dimension using an SQL expression:
    ```yaml
    dimensions:
      - name: full_name
        title: "Full Name"
        type: string
        sql: CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
    ```

- **Converting Unix timestamps**  
  If your table stores timestamps in Unix time, convert them to a date/time:
    ```yaml
    dimensions:
      - name: created_at
        title: "Signed Up At"
        type: time
        sql: TO_TIMESTAMP(created_at)
    ```

- **Applying numeric conversions**  
  For currency or other numeric transformations, use a calculated expression:
    ```yaml
    dimensions:
      - name: price
        title: "Price in Dollars"
        type: number
        sql: price_in_cents / 100.0
    ```
- **Anonymizing or Transforming Data**  
  Use **SQL expressions** to mask or obfuscate sensitive columns before exposing them in the UI. For example, if you only want to show part of a user’s email:
    ```yaml
    dimensions:
      - name: email_prefix
        title: "Email Prefix"
        type: string
        sql: SUBSTRING(email, 1, POSITION('@' IN email) - 1)
    ```

## Measures

**Measures** are the values you aggregate (such as a count of users or total revenue).

```yaml
  measures:
    - name: revenue
      type: sum
      sql: price_usd
  ```

### Basic Structure

Each measure has:
- `name`: A unique internal identifier.
- `title` (optional): A user-friendly name for display in the UI.
- `type`: The measure type (e.g., `count`, `sum`, `avg`).
- `sql`: Points to the column or expression you want to aggregate.
- `filters` (optional): A condition for a metric's calculation.

  ```yaml
    measures:
        - name: us_revenue
          type: sum
          sql: price_usd
          filters: 
            - sql: "{CUBE}.country = 'United States'"
  ```

- `meta` (optional): a parameter to store additional information for a measure. E.g. use `meta` to pass a `$` symbol for a currency column or any other custom info you want to access in your charting components.

  ```yaml
    measures:
        - name: price
          title: price in USD
          type: sum
          sql: price_usd
          meta:
            pretext: $
  ```

### Supported Measure Types

Embeddable (via Cube) supports the following measure types:

- [count](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#count)
- [count_distinct](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#count_distinct)
- [count_distinct_approx](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#count_distinct_approx)
- [sum](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#sum)
- [avg](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#avg)
- [min](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#min)
- [max](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#max)

### Examples

- **Basic Count**

  ```yaml
  measures:
    - name: total_customers
      title: "Total Customers"
      type: count
      sql: id
  ```

- **Summing a Numeric Column**

  ```yaml
  measures:
    - name: total_sales
      title: "Total Sales"
      type: sum
      sql: amount
  ```

- **Average Order Value**

  ```yaml
  measures:
    - name: average_order_value
      title: "Average Order Value"
      type: avg
      sql: total_price
  ```

- **Count Distinct (e.g., unique emails)**

  ```yaml
  measures:
    - name: unique_customers
      title: "Unique Customers"
      type: count_distinct
      sql: email
  ```

- **Calculated measures**

This example demonstrates how to reference measures within other measure definitions.

  ```yaml
  measures:
    - name: count
      sql: id
      type: count
  
    - name: paid_orders
      title: "Paid Orders"
      sql: id
      type: count
      filters:
        - sql: "{CUBE}.status = 'paid'"
    
    - name: percentage_paid
      sql: "100.0 * {paid_orders} / {count}"
      type: number
      format: percent
       
  ```


- **Rolling Count**  
  This measure counts orders over a rolling window, allowing you to track an ongoing total:

    ```yaml
    measures:
        - name: rolling_count
          type: count
          title: "Rolling Orders"
          description: "Cumulative count"
          rolling_window:
            trailing: unbounded
    ```

For more details, see the [Cube docs on rolling windows](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/rolling-window).
