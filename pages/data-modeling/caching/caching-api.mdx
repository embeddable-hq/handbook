# Caching API

Use Embeddableâ€™s Caching API to tell Embeddable which security contexts and pre-aggregations to refresh and how often:
   
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/caching/refresh-contexts', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'Accept': 'application/json',
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Keep your API key secure
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       refreshInterval: "30 minutes",
        embeddableIds: ['5f311740-d144-412e-aab8-3d9e632aba2f', '20e19de8-0C12-4c80-9ae9-db062c418f76'],
       scheduledRefreshContexts: [
         {
           securityContext: {
             userId: '9sZSJ9LHsiYXR0cmli'
           },
           environment: 'default'
         },
         {
           securityContext: {
             userId: 'HsiYXR0cmli9sZSJ9L'
           },
           environment: 'prod'
         }
       ]
     })
   });

   - `region`: your deployment region ([learn more](/deployment/deployment-regions)). 
   - `apiKey`: your [API key](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace#retrieve-your-api-key)
   - `refreshInterval`: (required) the refresh interval, in `minutes`, `hours`, or `days` (must be `30 minutes` or larger, currently).
   - `embeddableIds`: (required) the ids of Embeddables that you whose pre-aggregations you want refreshed 
   - `securityContext`: a JSON object [passed to your data models](/data-modeling/row-level-security#security-tokens-and-security-context) to enforce row-level security. 
   - `environment`: the environment (e.g. staging / prod, or a specific database for a single-tenant set up), pre-defined using our [Environments API](/data/environments).

If you load a dashboard using a security token containing a security context that has not been configured via the Caching API, no cache will be available for that dashboard.  Cube will therefore build the requested pre-aggregation on-demand, which may take some time.

Each time you call this it will **override** the previous settings. For example, if you want to stop a security context from refreshing, just call the API again with all security contexts except the one you want to stop.
