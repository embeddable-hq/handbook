# Caching API

Use Embeddable‚Äôs Caching API to tell Embeddable which security contexts and pre-aggregations to refresh and how often:
   
```javascript
fetch('https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/caching/refresh-contexts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Keep your API key secure
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    refreshInterval: "30 minutes",
    embeddables: [
      {
        id: "4beec55e-11f5-489a-8417-eb77c6a3c6c3",
        savedVersions: ["production"]  // If not provided, the latest saved version will be used by default
      }
    ],
    scheduledRefreshContexts: [
      {
        securityContext: {
          userId: '9sZSJ9LHsiYXR0cmli'
        },
        environment: 'default'
      },
      {
        securityContext: {
          userId: 'HsiYXR0cmli9sZSJ9L'
        },
        environment: 'prod'
      }
    ]
  })
});

  The `savedVersion` value for a given dashboard tells Embeddable which models and cube version it should use when refreshing pre-aggregations (e.g. it will use those tagged as ‚Äúproduction‚Äù)
</Callout>

   - `region`: your deployment region ([learn more](/deployment/deployment-regions)). 
   - `apiKey`: your [API key](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace#retrieve-your-api-key)
   - `refreshInterval`: (required) the refresh interval, in `minutes`, `hours`, or `days` (must be `30 minutes` or larger, currently).
    - `embeddables`: (required) a list of Embeddables to refresh. Each object must contain:
      - `id`: the unique identifier of the Embeddable dashboard.
      - `savedVersions`: (optional) an array of saved versions to refresh. If not provided, the latest saved version will be used by default.
   - `securityContext`: a JSON object [passed to your data models](/data-modeling/row-level-security#security-tokens-and-security-context) to enforce row-level security. 
   - `environment`: the environment (e.g. staging / prod, or a specific database for a single-tenant set up), pre-defined using our [Environments API](/data/environments).

If you load a dashboard using a security token containing a security context that has not been configured via the Caching API, no cache will be available for that dashboard.  Cube will therefore build the requested pre-aggregation on-demand, which may take some time.

Each time you call this it will **override** the previous settings. For example, if you want to stop a security context from refreshing, just call the API again with all security contexts except the one you want to stop.
