# Level 1 cache: in-memory

To deliver fast and responsive analytics, Embeddable leverages Cube's **Level 1 in-memory** cache.

- This cache is **enabled by default**.
- It can help **protect your database** from too much load.  
- It **does not** speed up a dashboard's first load.

You can tell Cube to evaluate and invalidate the Level 1 Cache using **Refresh Keys**. Learn more [here](https://cube.dev/docs/product/caching#refresh-keys). 

Cube does not recommend changing the default in-memory caching configuration unless necessary. Instead, to speed up query performance, you should use [pre-aggregations](/data-modeling/caching/level-2-cache/pre-aggregations).
