# Level 2 Cache: pre-aggregations

In addition to the Level 1 [in-memory cache](/data-modeling/caching/in-memory), Embeddable leverages Cube's Level 2 cache through **pre-aggregations** to enhance query performance and scalability.

Pre-aggregations compute and store aggregations (like sums, averages, counts) in advance, rather than calculating them on-the-fly for each query. When a query matches the structure of a pre-aggregation, results are retrieved directly from the pre-aggregated table instead of scanning raw data, significantly speeding up response times.

- Pre-aggregations need to be **configured** - they are **not enabled** by default.
- They can significantly **speed up query responses**, including during a dashboard's **initial load**.
- Pre-aggregations are **refreshed** using [Embeddable's Caching API](/data-modeling/caching/pre-aggregations#refreshing-pre-aggregations).

    If you're connecting to a Redshift database, please contact us to discuss setting up pre-aggregations, as the Redshift driver requires write-access.

## Defining Pre-Aggregations

One or multiple pre-aggregations can be specified directly within your `.cube.yml` model files.

### A simple example

Suppose you want to display a list of countries across various dashboard components. You can define a pre-aggregation like so:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    sql_table: public.customers

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        title: "Number of Customers"

    dimensions:
      - name: country
        sql: country
        type: string

    preAggregations:
        - name: customer_countries
        dimensions:
          - country
```
- `name`: an identifier used by Cube and Embeddable.
- `dimensions:` Specifies the dimensions to group by.

When a dashboard query requests the number of customers per country, Cube retrieves the data from the `customer_countries` pre-aggregated table instead of scanning the entire `customers` table.

### An example with a time dimension

To handle time-based analytics, such as tracking daily sales, you can define a pre-aggregation like so:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: public.orders

    dimensions:
      - name: country
        sql: country
        type: string

      - name: created_at
        sql: created_at
        type: time
    
    measures:
      - name: total_sales
        type: sum
        sql: amount
        title: "Total Sales"

    preAggregations:
      - name: daily_sales
        measures:
          - total_sales
        time_dimension: created_at 
        granularity: day
```

- `timeDimension:` Specifies the time dimension to handle time-based aggregations.
- `granularity:` Defines the level of detail for the aggregation (`day` in this case).

Learn more about defining pre-aggregations by visiting [Cube's documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/product/caching/getting-started-pre-aggregations).

## Refreshing pre-aggregations

Pre-aggregations in Cube need to be refreshed periodically to ensure they stay up to date with the latest data. This process involves recalculating the pre-computed summary tables based on your defined measures and dimensions. 

By default, pre-aggregations are **not refreshed**. You must call Embeddable's Caching API at least once to set the refresh interval and the security contexts to refresh. 

### Caching API

Use Embeddableâ€™s Caching API to tell us which security contexts to refresh and how often:
   
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://api.<region>.embeddable.com/api/v1/caching/refresh-contexts', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'Accept': 'application/json',
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Keep your API key secure
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       refreshInterval: "30 minutes",
       scheduledRefreshContexts: [
         {
           securityContext: {
             userId: '9sZSJ9LHsiYXR0cmli',
             regions: ['us-east', 'eu-west']
           },
           environment: 'default'
         }
       ]
     })
   });

   Response:
   Status 204 (No Content)
   ```
   - `region`: your deployment region. 
   - `apiKey`: your [API key](/getting-started/set-up-your-workspace#retrieve-your-api-key)
   - `refreshInterval`: the refresh interval, in `minutes`, `hours`, or `days`.
   - `securityContext`: a JSON object [passed to your data models](/data-modeling/row-level-security#security-tokens-and-security-context) to enforce row-level security. 
   - `environment`: the environment (e.g. staging / prod, or a specific database for a single-tenant set up), pre-defined using our [Environments API](/deployment/environments-api).

If you load a dashboard using a security token containing a security context that has not been configured via the Caching API, no cache will be available for that dashboard.

Each time you call this it will **override** the previous settings. For example, if you want to stop a security context from refreshing, just call the API again without that security context.
