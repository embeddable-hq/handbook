## Walkthrough video

Here is a short introduction to how Embeddable enables developers and product teams to build **beautiful**, pixel-perfect, **self-serve analytics** experiences, into their web-applications, for their customers.

## Why Embeddable?

Embeddable makes it easy to **build**, **edit**, **deploy**, and **scale customer-facing data experiences** - designed by your product team, built by engineering, and maintained by customer-facing and data teams. Exactly as it should be.

- **Native Feel** - Drop a simple [web component](/deployment/embedding) (`<em-beddable>`) into your site and let Embeddable handle the rest.

- **No-Code + Full-Code** - Non-technical users [drag and drop charts](/dashboards/introduction), filters, and controls, while developers retain control over [components](/development/introduction), [data models](/data-modeling/introduction), and security.

- **Security Built-In** - Filter [rows](/data-modeling/row-level-security), apply schema-level security, or [switch entire databases](/data/environments) per user if needed.

- **Single Source of Truth** - Define your metrics, dimensions, and transformations [in code](/data-modeling/defining-models). The no-code builder then exposes these for easy selection - no need for repeated SQL queries or one-off scripts.

- **Performance & Scalability** - Leverage caching and [advanced pre-aggregations](/data-modeling/caching/level-2-cache/pre-aggregations) to keep your data fast, even at scale.

## How It Works

You define **Data Models** and **Components** in your codebase, then use our SDK to expose them in a **powerful no-code builder** for your team. 

<Steps>

### **Define Data Models** 
   In code or in Embeddable's **data model editor**, [describe your data](/data-modeling/introduction) and how it's organised (e.g. "orders", "revenue", or "customers").  
### **Build or Use Starter Components**
   Pick from Embeddable’s growing [starter library](/dashboards/starter-components), or [define your own React components](/development/defining-components), pushing them to Embeddable using the SDK.   
### **No-Code Assembly**
   Team members use Embeddable’s [dashboard builder](/dashboards/introduction) to craft and iterate on interactive dashboards, without code.  
### **Publish & Embed**
   With a single `token` from [Embeddable’s Token API](/deployment/tokens-api), you can [embed](/deployment/embedding) each published dashboard anywhere.

</Steps>
