# Patch Notes - Vanilla Components v1

Version 1 of Vanilla Components introduced components as an NPM package, and is the new standard for Embeddable development that this documentation references. This page contains patch notes for each NPM release of Vanilla Components, including bug fixes, new features, and breaking changes (if any).

## Version 1.1.0 - Automatic Granularity
  - Updates components to work with the new automatic granularity feature in the Embeddable SDK, which recognizes when time dimensions are used and automatically adds a granularity picker just below them. In order to keep this release backwards-compatible with existing dashboards, any components (such as Time Series Bar Chart) that previously used a dedicated granularity picker will continue to do so. However, new components and any components that did not previously include a granularity picker will use the automatic granularity picker by default.

## Version 1.022 - Dropdown sort
  - Adds the ability to sort the Dropdown and Multi-Select Dropdown components

## Version 1.0.21 - Download Menu
  - Significantly improved the ability to theme the Download Menu. You can find all of the new theme values in the [default theme file](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts) in the new `downloadMenu` section. This change may introduce very slight visual differences in the Download Menu, but it is not a breaking change. The default values remain the same, the menu is just more flexible now.

## Version 1.0.20 - Chart Label Theme Improvements
  - Improved the handling of chart labels, allowing users to theme labels on a per-chart-type basis. This is a non-breaking change, as the default values remain the same. You can see all of the new theme values in the [default theme file](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts).

## Version 1.0.19 - Table Improvements
  - Ensured that the normal and pivot tables both display boolean values as "True" or "False" instead of just a blank string.

## Version 1.0.18 - Chart Fix
  - Fixed an issue with the Bar Chart and displaying axis values.

## Version 1.0.17 - CSS and Bar charts
  - Moved several CSS items in [`index.css`](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/components/vanilla/index.css) to [new theme values](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts). This is a non-breaking change as all the values are set to the same values as before.
  - The Bar Chart now automatically includes a "Granularity" sub input when the X-Axis is a date, allowing users to choose between "Day", "Week", etc. If you leave it blank, the chart defaults to "yyyy-mm-dd", eliminating those long, ugly UTC strings.
