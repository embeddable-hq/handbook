# Patch Notes - Vanilla Components v1

Version 1 of Vanilla Components introduced components as an NPM package, and is the new standard for Embeddable development that this documentation references. This page contains patch notes for each NPM release of Vanilla Components, including bug fixes, new features, and breaking changes (if any).

## Version 1.1.11 - KPI Improvements
  - Allowed KPI charts to abbreviate long numbers (eg `1,200` to `1.2k`, `1,200,000` to `1.2m`,   etc). This change is backwards compatible, as it defaults to "false" in the KPI inputs.

## Version 1.1.10 - Minor Improvements
  - Added an option in the Table and Pivot Table components to remove Markdown links from data and just leave the text that was linked (eg `[Embeddable](https://embeddable.com)` becomes `Embeddable` in the CSV.
  - Fixed an issue where the dropdown options were not expanding to the same size as the dropdown itself, causing text to be unnecessarily cut off.

## Version 1.1.9 - CORS and Table Improvements
  - Ensured that all Google font `link` tags have `crossorigin="anonymous"` which should help with potential CORS issues is some setups
  - Table cells can now display arbitrary JSON. Includes a new setting to indicate whether cells should expand to show the entirety of the JSON value or clip it.

## Version 1.1.8 - Heat Grid, z-index, and replaceAll fixes
  - Fixed Heat Grid Sizing Issues (it will now scroll horizontally in small containers)
  - Moved all hard-coded z-index values in components to theme
  - Fixed an issue where `replaceAll` was sometimes being called on non-string values coming in from Dimensions, leading to error messages.

## Version 1.1.7 - Bug Fixes
  - Updated Bar Chart "limit" input to properly reflect the existing default
  - Fixed a bug that was causing the stacked area chart to render a blank canvas in certain circumstances

## Version 1.1.6 - Internal Fix

  - Fixed an internal issue relating to publishing to NPM.

## Version 1.1.5 - Custom Granularities

  - Added support for custom granularities via Cube.js data models. This means you can now add e.g. "Last 15 minutes" or "Last 18 days" as options in the Granularity Picker and Date Range Picker w/ Granularity components. You can find more instructions on the [Extending Types](/development/extending-types) documentation page.

## Version 1.1.4 - Fixes and a New Components

  - Improved theming of fonts on controls (eg dropdown)
  - Updated to latest SDKs
  - Fixed default sort not always applying on Pivot table
  - Added a new component: Heat Grid! It's a Github-style heatmap grid that can be used to visualize data over time.

<ImageGrid width='90%' images={["/img/heat-grid.png"]}/>

## Version 1.1.3 - Small Fixes
  - Fixed "default sort direction" on Table component not always being applied
  - Adjusted Pie Chart logic so that if "view as percentages" is on, and CSV data is downloaded, the CSV data will also display percentages
  - Added Aria labels and role descriptions to all charts to improve accessibility
  - Improved `null` value handling with Download Button component (all `null`, `undefined`, or `No Value` values are now empty cells in the resulting CSV)

## Version 1.1.1 & 1.1.2 - Bug Fixes
  - Fixed an issue where the "Next" button on Table Pagination was not working correctly in some instances.
  - Fixed an issue where in rare cases the Table Chart would crash when interpreting strings and getting a `null` value instead of an empty string.

## Version 1.1.0 - Automatic Granularity
  - Updates components to work with the new automatic granularity feature in the Embeddable SDK, which recognizes when time dimensions are used and automatically adds a granularity picker just below them. In order to keep this release backwards-compatible with existing dashboards, any components (such as Time Series Bar Chart) that previously used a dedicated granularity picker will continue to do so. However, new components and any components that did not previously include a granularity picker will use the automatic granularity picker by default.

## Version 1.022 - Dropdown sort
  - Adds the ability to sort the Dropdown and Multi-Select Dropdown components

## Version 1.0.21 - Download Menu
  - Significantly improved the ability to theme the Download Menu. You can find all of the new theme values in the [default theme file](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts) in the new `downloadMenu` section. This change may introduce very slight visual differences in the Download Menu, but it is not a breaking change. The default values remain the same, the menu is just more flexible now.

## Version 1.0.20 - Chart Label Theme Improvements
  - Improved the handling of chart labels, allowing users to theme labels on a per-chart-type basis. This is a non-breaking change, as the default values remain the same. You can see all of the new theme values in the [default theme file](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts).

## Version 1.0.19 - Table Improvements
  - Ensured that the normal and pivot tables both display boolean values as "True" or "False" instead of just a blank string.

## Version 1.0.18 - Chart Fix
  - Fixed an issue with the Bar Chart and displaying axis values.

## Version 1.0.17 - CSS and Bar charts
  - Moved several CSS items in [`index.css`](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/components/vanilla/index.css) to [new theme values](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components-v1/blob/main/src/themes/defaulttheme.ts). This is a non-breaking change as all the values are set to the same values as before.
  - The Bar Chart now automatically includes a "Granularity" sub input when the X-Axis is a date, allowing users to choose between "Day", "Week", etc. If you leave it blank, the chart defaults to "yyyy-mm-dd", eliminating those long, ugly UTC strings.
